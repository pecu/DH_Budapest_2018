Why the inline string block in Ruby is named "eos"?

Update

Thank you for denoting the right way. I always thought that "eos" is a reserved word, but it seems that any word may be used:

a = <<MYSTRING
line 1
line 2
mystring #the thing is case sensitive
line3
MYSTRING
#Now really the end of string
I also got to know that this construction is named Heredoc

This question showed me that even the silliest questions may teach something.

This question does not appear to be about programming within the scope defined in the help center.
If this question can be reworded to fit the rules in the help center, please edit the question.

This is not correct. Heredoc syntax lets you use any identifier. EOS is just an example of such identifiers – SirDarius Feb 15 '13 at 11:33

I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question is not about a practical programming problem, as laid out in the help center. – Martijn Pieters♦ Mar 6 '15 at 17:38

EOS means end of string. it is displayed at the end of the string.

EOS means more than GFJKDHAGJHFGDJ for example.

But you can use other names, too.

Amazing! I never knew about that thinking that "eos" is a reserved word. So, this construction is named "Heredoc". I'll remember that. – Paul Feb 15 '13 at 12:12
