RBC Explains Today's Rush To BTFD

after plunging 150 points on syria airstrike headlines overnight, dow futures have retraced much of the losses this morning as any shift in the investing landscape towards 'risk-off' appears to have been dismissed as the buy-the-f**king-tomahawk-missile-launch-dip'ers are back in force betting on the success of the administration's tax reform, or stimulus, or earnings, or hope. however, gold prices remain elevated leaving some trace of doubt about president trump's actions. however, rbc's head of cross asset strategy, charlie mcelligott, points out that the missile strikes change none of the calculus for him ... the same way that terror attacks are tragic and scary and initially ‘spook’ people, historically they’ve been proven buying opps. the us strike doesn’t change the recent earnings growth pivot higher (esp in ‘cyclicals’); or the current crude squeezing higher and its +++ implications for higher “inflation expectations” / “more energy base-effect;” or ‘better’ global growth (china and eu pmis, while em too is looking back ‘online,’ with em equities proving to be a new ‘safe haven’ for $$$ coming-out of ‘rich’ us equities). this was a global ‘call to action’ off the back of the chemical attack, and it has received praise from everybody from sens. mccain to pelosi. we (the us) called the russians before-hand to tell them (and inform their syrian counterparts as well) what we were going to do—seriously. this was a symbolic “back up, we got a big stick” reminder. the near-to-medium-term ‘risk downside’ story to me remains largely about the rates move as ‘reflation’ has broken trend line (“the” pain trade for macros and unconstrained funds has been the flattening in edz7/8, as you’re seeing in some weak march performance #’s). with that (and any congruent ‘breakdown’ in 10y rates through this 2.30 symbolic level) you just see more of that same equities trend of ‘defensives’ and ‘bond proxies’ strength / more money $$$ chasing-into this ‘secular growth’ shift (tech, discretionary, biotech), and away from ‘cyclicals’ and ‘value’ which were the stories of ‘reflation’ / h216.  a very likely blackout / lack of news on us fiscal likely over next few months won’t help rejigger animal spirits either, so you could get that long-awaited pull-back during this ‘gap’ as well, or this current story out today from axios showing that potus is ‘eyeing’ a broad shakeout of his white house staff, including replacing priebus and bannon which could drive considerable “policy surprise” risk with the us administration…which of course too could be read as a “positive” from the markets if viewed as a shift ‘away’ from populism / extreme policy views…if you’re a ‘glass half-full’ kinda guy or gal. from the near-term risk perspective, i’ve also noted the “april effect” with us equity “momentum” market neutral strategies tending to rather violently underperform, which in light of 1) current heavy allocations to 12m ‘momentum leaders’ financials and tech sectors as well as 2) the largest factor crowding risk being ‘market’ (hedge funds still near historic highs in “high beta,” with the average dollar of hedge fund long us equity capital carrying ~ 20% more market risk than the s&p 500, per alphabetaworks), it’s still possible that any downdraft in popular trades could see an exacerbated de-risking move on the inherent outsized performance impact. ironically, some ‘good news’ for risk-assets focused on ‘looser or tighter’ financial conditions is that any “fed tapering” movement around ye (stopping reinvestment policy) will actually push back the hiking trajectory / timeline. so the thought is that this is looking to be a very ‘managed’ process, one that looks to prevent any sort of violent ‘financial tightening’ that the fed and risk assets dislike. of course that’s much easier said than done. mark orsley and i have been stating in marketing visits since january that increased interest-rate risk in the back half of the year around 1) ongoing fomc hikes 2) potential for fed cessation of reinvestments into ust / mbs 3) potential for ecb ‘rhetoric shift’ towards similar ‘wind-down language’ should drive rate vol higher, which can of course spill-over into risky-assets.  the idea that you can simply remove the daily buyer of mortgages from the market since the crisis—at a time where theoretically central banks have ‘inflected tighter’—is tricky as heck to execute, because if you’re long mortgages and rates are going against you (negative convexity), your first move and really only option is to hit usts. that’s just how it works, and this convexity hedging dynamic could then of course exacerbate said rate vol, which will impact the enormous combined assets and leverage of risk-parity strategies, which will impact vol targeting / risk control strategies, as the basis of the macro construct for the past 10 years has been about “lower (rates) and flatter.” but that’s for another email on another day. now if you really want to talk about the ultimate risk-asset support…look no further than the fed minutes from earlier in the week, where the fomc again “rolled-out” their “fed put.” despite all of the talk about their “data dependency” and how the labor market was “continuing to expand” while inflation in consumer prices “was close to the committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent,” it’s clear that it is markets which dictate to the fed, and not the other way around.  this “reflexivity conundrum” (as i’ve called it for years-now post the “taper tantrum” in ’13, sadly) continues to further embolden the buying in the same em equities, hy bonds and cre prices which the fomc claims to be concerned about as being elevated. by perpetually inserting flowery prose that there could be “…downside risks to their economic projections, if, for example, financial markets were to experience a significant correction,” the fed only further “green-lights” more of the same “buy the dip” / “sell front-month vol” behavior. and as noted above and perhaps most importantly, when paired with the apparent intentions to amend the current reinvestment policy before year-end (remember, kids: “tapering is tightening”), it very clearly suddenly priced-out hikes that the market had been expecting (another “ouch” for longs in banks, and certainly not ‘music to the ears’ of my ‘reflation’ recovery hedge xlf upside / xlk downside thesis). thus, the balance of risk remains in favor of upside for now until this muscle memory above (buy risk dips, sell vol) is changed. “the” macro ‘reflation’ trade is breaking down as the edz7/8 steepener violently flattens through support: see mark’s “macro scan” note from yesterday for more info, rates wonks . equity hf
