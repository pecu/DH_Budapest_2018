with a 95% implied probability of a rate hike tomorrow, there is little doubt that janet yellen will raise rates, although as goldman previewed two days , there are at least two open issues should make tomorrow's meeting somewhat interesting: first, will fed officials alter their policy views in response to the increasingly different signals that both sides of the mandate are sending about the urgency of further tightening... and ... second, will the press conference provide some clarity on what the next tightening step following the june hike will be ? but by and far, tomorrow's fomc announcement will be a non-event, unless - as some have suggested - yellen tries to collapse the extra easy monetary conditions which as db and gs calculated recently, are the loosest they have been since 2014 , courtesy of the ongoing qe at the ecb and boj. so instead of the much anticipated fomc, keep a closer eye on tomorrow's inflation report. according to rbc's charlie mcelliggott, the wednesday cpi print will have a more meaningful impact on the near term direction of the market than yellen's priced in decision. charlie explains: then again maybe not even the cpi will be a surprise: going into tomorrow's print, virtually all inflation proxies have already thrown in the towel. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our " how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] " guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .
