first rbc , now goldman. after core cpi inflation was lower than expected for the third consecutive month, and the year-over-year rate fell two tenths to +1.7%, goldman has made some changes to what it believes the fed will report at 2pm today. it now expects the fomc statement to include a stronger acknowledgement of the recent soft inflation data, and its expectations for the summary of economic projections " have become incrementally more dovish." the details: given further evidence of a more persistent core inflation shortfall, we now expect this afternoon’s fomc statement to include a stronger acknowledgement of the recent soft inflation data. specifically, we expect the committee to drop the word “somewhat” from the inflation characterization (from " inflation continued to run somewhat below 2 percent"). as shown in exhibit 1, we also now expect the summary of economic projections to continue to show a median of 3 rate hikes in 2018 (vs. our previous expectation of an increase to 3.5 hikes), as the hawkish impact of governor tarullo’s retirement is now expected to be offset by a shift of one of “4-hikers” to three hikes in 2018. we also now expect the 2017 core pce projection to decline by two tenths to +1.7% (vs. our previous expectation of a one tenth downgrade). these developments also increase our conviction that the committee will lower its long-term unemployment rate projection (to 4.6%). exhibit 1: our updated expectations for the june survey of economic projections tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our " how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] " guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .
