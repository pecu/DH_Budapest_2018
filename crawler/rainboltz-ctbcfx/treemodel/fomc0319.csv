44,"Trader: ""We Need Another 20 Basis Points For The Entire Narrative To Change""",2017-06-20 14:23:00+00:00,"as noted yesterday , bloomberg trading commentator richard breslow refuses to jump on the bandwagon that the fed is hiking right into the next policy mistake. in fact, he is pretty much convinced that yellen did the right thing... she just needs some help from future inflationary print (which will be difficult, more on that shortly), from the dollar (which needs to rise), and from the yield curve. discussing the rapidly flattening yield curve, breslow writes that ""the 2s10s spread can bear-flatten through last year’s low to accomplish the break, but i don’t think you get the dollar motoring unless the yield curve holds these levels and bear- steepens. traders will set the bar kind of low and start getting excited if 10-year yields can breach 2.23%. but at the end of the day we need another 20 basis points for the entire narrative to change ."" to be sure, hawkish commentary from fomc members on monday (with the semi-exception of charles evans ) and earlier this morning from rosengren, is doing everything whatever it can to achieve this. here are the highlights from the boston fed president. ah yes, the ""dudley paradox"" in which suddenly low rates are bad for the economy. thanks for telling us, fed. anyway, beside rates, breslow says - and we agree - that the market will need one more thing: ""what you need for a true dollar bounce is a half-way decent inflation print, of any sort, coupled with a break of the two-year treasury note above 1.40%. doesn’t seem like a big ask, but it needs to happen. "" it may not be a ""big ask"", but it is one which has to be directed at beijing, which as we have repeatedly shown is the primary driver of the global inflationary impulse, and which in recent months has crashed at the fastest rate since the financial crisis. in other words, for the fed to be ""right"", china will have to be willing to risk another modest economic overheating and end its deleveraging ambitions, if only for the time being. here is breslow's full note. the dollar needs bonds to get with the program i’ve read a number of dollar bullish pieces today. the pendulum is swinging. wasn’t it only last week that everyone was telling us that the market was fading the fomc’s “policy error ?” that there was no way they would meet their rate hike forecasts? well, a couple of 21-day moving averages later and traders are getting ginned up. i confess to having a lot of sympathy for the view. i’m not in the it was a mistake camp. but you need to ask yourself what it’ll actually take to make it so beyond a few days of it not imploding. just keep reminding yourself that we’ve seen these prices before and something needs to have actually changed for us to break into new territory. the trends we’ve had, haven’t been where people were looking. it’s tough to argue that the economy is cooling, inflation is weakening but rates will begin to propel the dollar. they haven’t done it yet under that duality. what you need for a true dollar bounce is a half-way decent inflation print, of any sort, coupled with a break of the two-year treasury note above 1.40%. doesn’t seem like a big ask, but it needs to happen. the 2s10s spread can bear-flatten through last year’s low to accomplish the break, but i don’t think you get the dollar motoring unless the yield curve holds these levels and bear- steepens. traders will set the bar kind of low and start getting excited if 10-year yields can breach 2.23%. but at the end of the day we need another 20 basis points for the entire narrative to change . the fed will continue to talk tough, president charles evans notwithstanding. they are motivated hikers and are praying the numbers don’t make them look incautious . if you disagree with the dots, do it based on economics not on their perceived level of seriousness. governor carney just told us he has a deeply split committee that won’t be going anywhere too fast. he may actually have a problem on his hands and needs to stay out of the brexit debate. president draghi is going to delay revealing his plans for as long as possible but that’s because he’s going to have a hard time convincing the council to remain as dovish as he’d like. and he won’t get any backing from analysts who will continue to push the “europe is back” theme. governor kuroda has no appetite for doing anything that causes the yen to race higher . same goes for the other developed market governors. re-read snb president jordan’s comments from this morning. on another front, keep a close eye on gold . it is sitting on important support at 1,246 and if it breaks down, dollar bulls will get excited. if it holds, more of the same. the best part of nascent dollar strength is it will keep things interesting, despite the time of the year, and has an optimistic feel about it. which definitely isn’t a bad thing under the circumstances. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",2s10s China 2s10s Yield Curve Yen 2s10s.

52,"Futures, European Stocks Flat As Oil Suddenly Tumbles; Pound Slides",2017-06-20 11:44:00+00:00,"european stocks were flat after starting off strongly earlier, dragged lower by energy stocks. asian stocks, u.s. futures little changed as oil tumbled with brent tumbling as low as $45.85/bbl to the lowest intraday since november 30 and taking out a 38.2% fib support, after a one-minute spike in volume to a day-high 5,208 lots just after 6am, with wti mirroring brent's momentum, and falling as much as 98c to $43.22, lowest since november 14. as reuters' jamie mcgeever points out, ""maybe not too much of a surprise to see oil prices fall, given how much the g10 economic surprises index has collapsed in recent weeks."" maybe not too much of a surprise to see oil prices fall, given how much the g10 economic surprises index has collapsed in recent weeks. pic.twitter.com/axkvhozzmt — jamie mcgeever (@reutersjamie) june 20, 2017 the pound sank for a second day, with the gbpusd tumbling to 1.2661, alongside gilt yields as britain central bank governor mark carney reversed the earlier boe ""vote split"" hawkishness and said he is still worried about the impact brexit will have on the u.k. economy and said he ""now is not the time"" to raise rates. sterling weakened against all of its group-of-10 peers, and gilt yields declined as carney said that domestic inflation pressures remain subdued. speaking at london’s mansion house on tuesday, he also highlighted the weakness in the economy and the increased uncertainty as the nation formally starts talks to exit the european union. carney’s first major speech since may comes a day after negotiations over britain’s exit from the european union formally began, and his comments addressing weakness in the u.k. economy and subdued inflation join a raft of talking points for investors this week.  as bloomberg adds, carney’s comments were seen as pushing back against a hawkish shift at last week’s monetary policy committee meeting, where three members unexpectedly voted to raise the benchmark rate from a record-low 0.25 percent. that split in the mpc is exacerbating the uncertainty faced by pound traders as the u.k. begins its brexit negotiations in the wake of inconclusive elections earlier this month. sterling’s weakness boosted u.k. stocks with the ftse 100 and 250 both benefitting from the falling sterling and regained some early losses seen in the uk indices. similarly, in a speech late in u.s. time on monday, chicago federal reserve president charles evans said it may be worthwhile for the u.s. central bank to wait until year-end to decide whether to raise rates again. also overnight, we got the latest in a string of appearances from u.s. central bank officials when federal reserve vice chairman stanley fischer speaking in amsterdam, discussing the impact of low rates on high home prices. hong kong shares retreated ahead of msci inc.’s decision on whether to include china’s domestic equities in its main indexes. as a reminder the msci will announce whether it approved chinese-listed stocks in its global benchmarks. china's $6.8 trillion onshore market is the world’s second largest and accounts for 9% of global stock value, but has been rejected for index inclusion three times by msci over issues including capital controls and long trading halts. msci’s decision is expected tuesday after the close of u.s. markets. elsewhere, japan's nikkei jumped to a near two-year high on tuesday while japan’s topix rose 0.7% to the highest since august 2015 amid weakness in the yen. in europe, the stoxx 600 was up less than 0.1% as of 11:33am in london, trimming gains of as much as 0.3% with miners and energy shares lead declines among sectors as crude extends drop to lowest intraday since nov. 15. stoxx 600 miners down 1.7%, tracking copper prices lower, while banks were the third-worst decliners as 10- year german bond yield falls. drops offset by gains in food and beverage and media stocks, among others. as noted above, brent crude oil hit new year-to-date low at $45.85, which could spur a move toward the $44.66 measured support line according to bloomberg technician sejul gokal; possible trend-exhaustion signals may temporarily delay the move. brent crude oil -1.7% to 46.02. support at $44.66 represents the 100% extension line of april-may selloff (~$10 selloff), projected from may peak ($54.67). drop to support may not happen immediately as market on possible trend-exhaustion signal. west texas oil erased a gain to slump 1.7 percent to $43.44 a barrel. gold climbed 0.2 percent to $1,246.36 an ounce, after closing monday at the lowest in more than a month. in rates, the yield on 10-year treasuries dropped one basis point to 2.18 percent, after rising four basis points monday. benchmark yields in the u.k. fell after carney's dovish comments with the yield on 10-year gilts dropping 2bps to 1.0%, having earlier dropped 4bps. odds of a 25bps hike by end of 2018 tumbled to ~47% according to mpc=dated sonias, compared with around 77% ahead of carney's comments. currencies saw the british pound falling 0.3 percent to $1.2695, erasing an earlier gain. the euro edged 0.1 percent higher to $1.1155. the bloomberg dollar spot index was little changed, after advancing 0.4 percent on monday. the measure touched the lowest level since october last week. the yen fell 0.1 percent to 111.61 per dollar. the currency retreated 0.6 percent on monday. bulletin headline summary from ransquawk top overnight news from bbg market snapshot in asian markets, stocks were mixed after failing to sustain the momentum from wall street where stocks closed at fresh all time highs after the tech sector rebounded from last week's underperformance and the djia extended into record territory. nikkei 225 (+1.1%) outperformed and printed fresh 22-month highs due to a weaker currency, while asx 200 (-0.5%) was dampened by softness across commodities and with financials pressured after moody's downgraded ratings on australia's big 4 banks. shanghai comp. (+0.1%) and hang seng (-0.1%) traded choppy after the pboc's reduced its liquidity operations to a paltry cny1obln, which was counterbalanced by a decline in money market rates with the cnh overnight hibor at an 8-month low. 10yr jgbs were subdued amid a positive risk tone in japan and with the demand at the enhanced liquidity auction for super-long jgbs virtually unchanged from prior. in european bourses, the ftse 100 and 250 both benefited from the falling sterling and regained some early losses seen in the uk indices, stemmed by equity specific morning news, where poor earnings from wolseley (wos ln) and orange reducing its stake in bt (bt/a ln) set the ftse off to a slow start. the eurostoxx 600 sectors were positive, with 9/10 trading the morning in the green — the noticeable laggard was the energy sector, with wti and brent crude failing to bounce from yesterday's losses. fixed income markets were led by gilts, as the aforementioned dovish tone from carney led gilts to outperform, trading near session highs, as the other triple a's followed. note, supply from europe is particularly light this week. top european news in currencies, the price action this morning has been focused on the pound, as boe gov carney allayed any 'fears' that uk rates were on the rise any time soon. this was a known factor given the vote split revealed last week, but the algos jumped on his accommodative tone on policy over the near term, focusing on anaemic wage growth — we also knew this — as reported in the jobs report last week. even so, cable dived below 1.2700 from circa 1.2750, while from the mid 0.8700's, we were testing 0.8800 again. both pairs have since pulled back off their respective extremes, with brexit themes and the cordial start to the talks yesterday proving supportive to a very modest degree. elsewhere, usd/jpy remains the key path for usd bulls concurring with fed chair yellen last week and ny's dudley yesterday. we still run into seller ahead of 112.00, as their optimistic tunes are clearly being met with scepticism from some quarters. modest gains in mid curve ust yield is testament to this. eur/usd is still finding buyers well ahead of 1.1100, with this morning's upturn in eur/gbp having provided some support. in commodities, since the fomc announcement last week, the usd has recovered some ground, notably against the usd as treasuries have edged lower. this has fed into some weakness in gold which is now trading below usd1250, with silver finding a little more support having lagged the yellow metal on the way up. the steady risk tone has also added to weakness here, and as a result, base metals have pushed up to a modest degree. copper is a little more balanced, but aluminium, zinc and lead all showing moderate gains on the day but with few individual drivers which stand out. oil prices have also stabilised, but as we have noted in recent weeks, the backdrop of rising us shale production precludes any significant upturn in wti or brent — both still trading relatively close to the recent lows, but wti finding support well ahead of the key usd40 mark. looking at the day ahead, we’ve got another fairly thin calendar of data ahead of us today. we’ll get current account balance readings for both the us and euro area. china’s conference board leading index is also out this afternoon. it’s a busy day for fedspeak though with fischer (3.15pm edt), rosengren (8.15am edt) and kaplan (3pm edt) all scheduled to speak. house speaker ryan's speech will also be a key focus. us event calendar * * * db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap not many divorce settlements start with a cheery exchange of gifts between the spurned partners. well brexit is like no divorce in history as uk brexit secretary david davies yesterday kickstarted talks by giving eu lead negotiator michel barnier a rare mountaineering book with a hiking stick going in the opposite direction. there was no suggestion that the latter gift was europe's way of asking the uk to take a hike. in fact everything was very cordial. if it carries on like this (unlikely) it could be the friendliest divorce since coldplay's chris martin and gwyneth paltrow's conscious uncoupling. we'd note that the latter sung backing vocals on coldplay's last album so proof that it is possible to remain friends. the first round perhaps went to the eu as the uk agreed to their sequencing of sorting out agreement on the divorce payments first before any trade negotiations could progress. it seems eu and uk citizen rights living in the other's region will be discussed early on in the talks as will the contentious irish border issue. uk brexit minister david davis confirmed that the uk would present its offer on rights for citizens at some stage next week. timing wise we’re expecting one week of negotiations every month. in between those weeks consultations and technical work will go on behind the scenes. for now the overall tone and relationship between the two camps in the press conference yesterday appeared friendly and talks as being constructive in the very early going. however expect the real details to emerge in the weeks and months ahead. it’s worth pointing out that there is an eu leaders’ summit this thursday and friday which might provide a decent summary as to how the first week of talks has proceeded. with those talks going on behind the scenes then, in an otherwise fairly quiet start to the week most of the focus was on comments from the ny fed’s dudley. most significant appeared to be his remark that recent rate hikes by the fed have not tightened financial conditions to any significant degree and also that halting the tightening cycle now would imperil the expansion. dudley appeared upbeat about the us economy overall and also that the expansion has “a long way to go”. on inflation he said that prices are a little lower than what the fed would want – which was no great surprise – but also that he expects  wage growth to quicken a bit more as the job market continues to tighten. so overall fairly upbeat and the comments helped both the greenback to firm up (dollar index +0.40%) and treasury yields to edge higher (10y +3.7bps to 2.190%), while gold (-0.79%) nudged lower. overnight we’ve also heard from the chicago fed’s evans who was similarly upbeat. the fed official said that the “real economy is really doing quite well” and that “i think where we are with the funds rate right now is kind of in line with my outlook”. he didn’t offer any further clues as to his expectation for how many more hikes we might get this year but did say that “the important feature is that the current environment supports very gradual rate hikes and slow preset reductions in our balance sheet”. staying with the us for a moment, it’s worth noting that house speaker paul ryan is due to deliver his first major speech on tax reform in an address today. it’s due to kick off at 12.45pm et/5.45pm bst. that should be well worth keeping an eye on. elsewhere in markets yesterday it was a decent start to the week for global equity markets with the s&p 500 (+0.83%) and dow (+0.68%) both rallying to new record highs. a decent rebound for the nasdaq (+1.42%) appeared to be the main driver as tech stocks surged after being beaten up in recent days. in fact the nasdaq actually had its best day since november 7th and is now 'only' 1.66% off its intraday all-time high from june 8th and up 2.10% from its intraday low on june 9th when it had a mini sell-off. for all that talk of a correction it’s worth also highlighting that the nasdaq has now gone 154 consecutive sessions without a 5% drawdown from the peak. the record is 156 days set in he mid-1980’s. elsewhere yesterday european equities also turned in a solid session with the stoxx 600 (+0.86%) having its best day since april 24th. this morning in asia, despite a positive start, most major bourses have pared early gains and faded. the hang seng (-0.02%), shanghai comp (-0.12%) and kospi (-0.05%) are little changed as investors await the decision on whether or not the msci will include mainland china stocks in its benchmark indices later today. elsewhere the asx (-0.41%) is underperforming with banks under pressure after moody’s yesterday downgraded australia’s major banks. the one market which has rallied this morning is the nikkei (+1.10%) which appears to be getting some support from a weaker yen. moving on. while there was no significant macro data released yesterday we did get the latest ecb cspp holdings data. although the average daily run rate was €318mn and below the average daily run rate since cspp started of €366mn, the cspp/pspp ratio was still 12.7%, which is above the average of 11.6% before qe was trimmed in april. so after a buoyant may where cspp seemed to increase again (likely in line with high issuance), we've dropped back down to lower than average levels. however the ratio still suggests a higher taper for pspp than cspp. staying with the ecb, there was a bit of focus on comments from governing council member jan smets yesterday. he said that the ecb is closely watching wages and inflation expectations with the ecb still not seeing convincing signs that price stability can be supported without monetary support. the eur 5y5y inflation swap rate is currently holding at 1.533% and at around 7-month lows. meanwhile over at the boe silvana tenreyro was appointed to the bank’s mpc as kristen forbes’ (a notable hawk) replacement. she will start next month. tenreyo is currently a professor at the lse and a former bank of mauritius official. it’s difficult to really get a gauge on where she sits on the hawk-dove scale although we do know that she has published an academic paper arguing the impact of monetary policy as being asymmetric which could put her closer to the core of the committee than forbes. at least the current balmy english summer is somewhat comparable to the warmer mauritius climate. looking at the day ahead, we’ve got another fairly thin calendar of data ahead of us today. we’ll get current account balance readings for both the us and euro area, along with ppi data in germany this morning. china’s conference board leading index is also out this afternoon. it’s a busy day for fedspeak though with fischer (8.15pm bst), rosengren (1.15pm bst) and kaplan (8pm bst) all scheduled to speak. the aforementioned house speaker ryan speech will also be a key focus. the other key event for markets today is the mansion house speeches by boe governor carney and chancellor of the exchequer hammond. the event was rescheduled as a breakfast so we are expecting the speeches to take place early this morning. tips: tips [ at ]

73,"Evans Flips From Hawkish To Dovish, Says Fed ""Could Wait Until December"" Before Next Hike",2017-06-20 01:13:00+00:00,"earlier today, ny fed president bill dudley sparked a hawkish storm in the markets, when in a bizarre statement  he doubled down on the yellen's ""hawkish hike"" rhetoric, and  made it seem that easing is now perceived by the fed as a bad thing: then moments ago, today's second fed speaker of the day, chicago fed's dovish, fomc voter charles evans delivered a dr. jekyll and mr. hyde statement, where first, in his prepared remarks and during the subsequent q&a in new york he sounded rather hawkish, while speaking to reporters after the event he flipped at emerged as his usual old dovish self. first, here are the highlights from the dovish evans: he also said something which really doesn't make any sense, to wit: “i want to assure you that if we know things are going wrong we will act.” the statement is clearly meaningless because on countless occasions the fed has said it has no way of seeing asset bubbles in advance, and since an asset bubble is the biggest risk facing global markets, one wonders just how the fed could know that ""things are going wrong."" and then as he was leaving, the dovish evans we all know so well, made a surprise appearance: his non-committal conclusion was that “we’re at a point where we’d be well- served to meaningfully monitor the data.” during his speech, the dollar initially strengthened, then weakened, but since the end of his speech it has resumed its autopilot move higher as dudley's comments clearly take presedence, bizarre as they may have been. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Bill Dudley,1
87,Monetary Madness - Beware The FOMC Jaberwocky,2017-06-19 20:46:00+00:00,"authored by economicprism's mn gordon , annotated by acting-man's pater tenebrarum , “the hurrier i go, the behinder i get,” is oft attributed to the white rabbit from lewis carroll’s, alice in wonderland.  where this axiom appears within the text of the story is a mystery.  but we suspect the white rabbit must utter it about the time alice follows him down the rabbit hole. pick a rabbit to follow… no doubt, today’s wage earner knows what it means to work harder, faster, and better, while slip sliding behind. however, for many wage earners the reasons why may be somewhat mysterious.  at first glance, they may look around and quickly scapegoat foreigners   for their economic woes. yet like wonderland, things are often not as they first appear.  when it comes to today’s financial markets, there is hardly a connection to the real economy at all.  stock markets are just off record highs, yet 6 in 10 americans don’t have $500 to cover an unexpected bill. a curious fellow may look around and find more questions than answers. where is the money coming from?  where is it going? before he knows it, he’s gone down the rabbit hole where he observes the darnedest things.  he may even discover that the federal reserve, with its fiat money, has created and perpetuated insane and incomprehensible levels of debt. and that this, in turn, has blown the economy up into a massive financial bubble. what bubble? it is perfectly normal for large cap stocks to rise six-fold in a little over eight years. as you can see from the insert, it’s a real thinking man’s market. that means, it is a market that is giving men time to think about other things than the market. after all, it only goes up…  a market for passivists, so to speak, for peaceful prozac junkies and valium zombies.  when asked “ what do you say to fed officials who worry about potential bubbles in asset prices? ”  former fomc member narayana havenstein recently noted: “ i am not convinced that these are major risks to the economy.” see? nothing to worry about! nothing can go wrong… ommm … – click to enlarge. on top of that, if he follows the money, he will see that the fed’s endeavors have resulted in extreme the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few while looting the many.  hence, he’s discerned a more accurate reason why the wage earner must run faster and faster while falling further and further behind. obviously, such a mad system can’t go on forever. but it can go on much longer than any honest person would dream possible.  the experience since tricky dick nixon closed the gold window nearly 46-years ago bears this out. moreover, the experience over the last 8-years, attempting to normalize from zirp and qe, confirms the unique ability for madness to persist. in short, monetary policy has gone mad as a hatter. its reasons don’t rhyme and its rhymes don’t reason. just this week for instance, fed chair janet yellen raised the price of credit in the face of a deflating economy. doesn’t this go contrary to the fed’s standard operating procedures?  are they just providing cover for the next great market bust? is the evil rabbit getting ready to disturb the peace? the annual growth rate of the true us money supply tms-2 has now declined to its lowest level since september of 2008, and commercial &industrial lending seems close to crossing the zero line the wrong way (in preparation of falling off the chart, presumably). the last time business credit grew at such a slow pace was on the way up in april 2011, a very different situation. total bank lending growth (including mortgage loans and other loans to consumites) is at a new low for the move as well (4.31% y/y). obviously, we have no problem with that… but it is a bit bizarre to read fed missives about “balance sheet normalization” under these circumstances. we have to wonder what the planers are looking at (it can’t be this chart, that much is certain). is the fed about to voluntarily and deliberately shrink the money supply and precipitate a stock market crash? that is really hard to believe… more likely they are mesmerized by a mandate-driven false sense of security – click to enlarge. to be frank, to carry out the dirty deed of price fixing credit markets one must possess credentials from a prestigious university, have worked under a lengthy and trusted tutelage, and proven to be of elite pedigree. when it comes down to it, the philosophy is superficially based on the unfounded belief that one can connect the dots of fabricated data and then monkey up or down the price of credit to make future fabricated data appear more to the fed’s liking. below the surface, however, the real philosophical nuts and bolts are revealed; it’s all about keeping the big bankers flush with cash and credit so they can collect rents while indenturing generation after generation with lifetimes of debt. here is a brief excerpt from wednesday’s fomc statement . the charade yellen and the fed must play are straight out of wonderland. “the committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.  inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. “in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent.  the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.” this is fomc jabberwocky at its finest. still, the fed fails to mention one very critical piece of nonsense. that is, if one runs fast enough one can sometimes catch the rabbit. beware the jabberwocky! eagle-eyed readers will already have discovered the associated  poem. this chart was recently shown at zerohedge . the correlation between central bank balance sheets and the “fang” stocks is not what is most interesting about it in our opinion – rather it is the fact that the fangs and the rest of the market are drifting apart (the ratio of the cap-weighted vs. the equal-weighted spx is actually already a relative performance proxy). this correlates actually quite closely with the slowdown in money supply growth shown above (y-o-y tms-2 growth hit an interim peak in november 2016 and has been roughly cut in half since then). similar behavior could be observed close to nearly every major market peak (“close” is a relative term though – it is not possible to determine a priori how long such a divergence will persist. we plan to discuss this shortly in a separate post). tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Tricky Dick Federal Reserve Janet Yellen Monetary Policy Money Supply Market Crash Market Conditions Mortgage Loans,1
109,"BofA: ""Has The Fed Become Concerned About The Surge In Stocks?""",2017-06-19 14:35:00+00:00,"in a unexpectedly gloomy note from bofa's chief strategist david woo, titled ""sell before it's too late"", the analyst writes that this is "" a market with risk off written all over it "" largely as a result of a string of weaker-than-expected us data over the past week, which ""has only strengthened our view that the us economy is losing momentum"" and adds that the culprit is the lack of progress in tax reform in washington. as woo explains, the reason for his gloomy economic view is that  companies after companies across the country have been telling the bank lately that they are withholding major decisions on hiring and investment until there is greater clarity on tax reform, which he says ""should come as no surprise."" running a business without knowing what taxes you will be paying, whether interest and labor costs will be tax deductible, how long you have for capital expenditure depreciation is like driving at night without headlights. if you can't see, you slow down ? the increased uncertainty around tax reform has become a damper on economic growth. the data are bearing out this wait-and-see attitude. core durable goods orders have been flat for three consecutive months and the three-month moving average of nonfarm payrolls slowed in may to the most sluggish pace since the eurozone crisis in 2012 what did surprise woo is that against a backdrop of a rolling over economy, the fed doubled down on its hawkish tone and wonders "" what it sees (""solid"" job gains, businness fixed investment that ""continues to expand"", risk to the economy being ""roughly balanced"") that we do not. "" his answer: ""can it be the case that its hawkishness was prompted by something other than its reading of the economy? for example, is it possible that the fed has become concerned about the recent surge in the equity market, especially tech stocks that has been feeding off low interest rates and low volatility? according to our equity strategists, the p/e of the tech sector (19x) is currently at its highest levels post-crisis while the ev/sales ratio is at the highest sinec the tech bubble"" woo adds that whether the fed's hawkiness was indeed intended as a warning shot to tech stocks or not, momentum behind the recent tech rally was already fading even before the fomc meeting. the fact that large cap active funds have never been more overweight the tech sector in the history of our data and the possibility that there could be a bigger correction ahead make us think that the balance of risks for both us rates and usd/jpy remains on the downside (notwithstanding the fed's plan to hike one more time and to start shrinking its balance sheet this year). it's not just tech however, because as the bofa strategist also notes, ""the price action in the energy market is also raising a red flag in our eyes. in the face of continued inventory build and increasing rig count (chart 2), wti front month contracts fell to a two-month low last week. bofa's commodity team maintains its view that supply/demand balance points to a deficit of 830 thousand b/d over 2h2017 but is becoming concerned that hedging ratios among north american producers for 2018 are only a quarter of their normal levels . as woo warns, if wti breaks below $44 per barrel (it is currently at $44.68), $38-40 levels could be in play . to be sure, today's hawkish comments by dudley in light of last week's increasingly disappointing economic data suggest that the fed is indeed focused on ""other things"" although if yellen is hoping to mute the relentless grind higher in stocks, one look at today's market action shows that she and the fed will both have to try much harder... tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Volatility B+ fixed Price Action Eurozone,1

213,"One Fed President Says The Rate Hike Decision Was A Choice ""Between Faith And Data""",2017-06-16 16:52:00+00:00,"over the years many have accused central banking of being the world's latest (and most profitable) religion, with central bankers the only modern day priests left that still matter (to the tune of $75 trillion, the market cap of all stocks in the world). today, in a blog post from minneapolis fed president neel kashkari explaining why he dissented from the latest fed rate hike decision, he admits as much when he says "" for me, deciding whether to raise rates or hold steady came down to a tension between faith and data . on one hand, intuitively, i am inclined to believe in the logic of the phillips curve: a tight labor market should lead to competition for workers, which should lead to higher wages. eventually, firms will have to pass some of those costs on to their customers, which should lead to higher inflation. that makes intuitive sense. that’s the faith part. "" in a surprisingly honest assessment, he then says that "" unfortunately, the data aren’t supporting this story, with the fomc coming up short on its inflation target for many years in a row, and now with core inflation actually falling even as the labor market is tightening . if we base our outlook for inflation on these actual data, we shouldn’t have raised rates this week. instead, we should have waited to see if the recent drop in inflation is transitory to ensure that we are fulfilling our inflation mandate."" which inductively suggests that the rest of the fomc is still driven by, well, faith alone. unfortunately, this time the faith has consequences, and as citi's matt king explained earlier , the fed's decision to not only hike rates but also to begin a $450 billion annual reduction in its balance sheet, will have ""significant adjustment in valuations."" which is perhaps ironic, because while kashkari's opinion is quite objective on the topic of america's economic realities, he continues to be disappointing blind about the fed's true purpose, namely to prop up asset prices, to wit: ""while some asset prices appear elevated, i don’t see a correction as being likely to trigger financial instability. investors would face losses from a stock market correction, but it’s not the fed’s job to protect investors from losses. our jobs are to achieve our dual mandate and to promote financial stability."" which is funny, because while the priests over at the fed continue to live in their ivory towers, everyone figured out what was going on, and as citi said earlier this week,"" the principal transmission channel to the real economy has been lifting asset prices.

229,"Quiet Start To Quad Witching: Stocks Rebound Around The Globe, BOJ Hits Yen",2017-06-16 11:37:00+00:00,"today is quad-witching opex friday, and according to jpm , some $1.3 trillion in s&p future will expire. traditionally quad days are associated with a rise in volatility and a surge in volumes although in light of recent vol trends and overnight markets, today may be the most boring quad-witching in recent history: global stocks have again rebounded from yesterday's tech-driven losses as european shares rose 0.6%, wiping out the week's losses. usd/jpy climbed to two-week high, pushing the nikkei higher as the boj maintained its stimulus and raised its assessment of private consumption without making a reference to tapering plans, all as expected. asian stocks were mixed with the shanghai composite slightly softer despite the pboc injecting a monster net 250 billion yuan with reverse repos to alleviate seasonal liquidity squeeze, and bringing the net weekly liquidity injection to cny 410 billion, the highest in 5 months, while weakening the cny fixing most since may. wti crude is up fractionally near $44.66; dalian iron ore rises one percent. oil rose with metals. treasuries held losses as traders focused on yellen hawkish tone. the msci all country world index was up 0.2%, and after the latest global rebound, the value of global stocks is almost equal to that of the world's gdp, the highest such ratio since th great financial crisis, bbg reported. the key overnight event was the bank of japan which concluded the latest round of central bank meetings and maintained its extraordinary stimulus intact. governor kuroda calmed market speculation that an exit- plan communication was under way as he noted that the boj is only halfway to its inflation target. the yen dropped versus all of its group-of-10 peers and was down by 0.3 percent to 111.3 per dollar as of 6:00 a.m. edt.  the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1175. the dollar stood little changed on a weekly basis as demand for its major peers waned given policy makers outside the u.s. showed no intention of altering their monetary stance european stocks advanced in a broad rally following two days of declines. investors bought automakers after solid car sales data, while food and beverage makers led the advance which swept across all european industry group, with nestle s.a. the biggest gainer after it revealed plans to shake up u.s. operations. u.k. retailer tesco plc registered its best quarter in seven years. the stoxx europe 600 index rose 0.6 percent as of 9:58 a.m. in london, paring its weekly decline to 0.6 percent. france’s cac 40 rose 1 percent, the most among european peers, outperforming ahead of the weekend’s election. as bloomberg notes , the latest positive change in mood comes at the end of a difficult week for stocks, with the benchmark european index recovering from the lowest close in almost two months. the markets appear to be shacking off bearish sentiment brought about by the fed’s third interest rate increase since december. in france, newly elected emmanuel macron looks set for an historic majority in the national assembly on sunday. in rates, 10y yields rose one basis point to 2.17% after rising four basis points in the previous session. the rate dropped on wednesday to 2.13%, the lowest level since november. u.k. benchmark yield advanced three basis points after the boe surprised the market with an unexpectedly hawkish vote split in yesterday's mpc decision. the german 2y yield jumped to the highest level since november, although it still remains deeply in negative territory. west texas crude futures rose 0.6 percent to $44.71 a barrel. oil is down about 2.4 percent for the week. gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,254.80. the metal is heading for a second weekly loss, falling 0.9 percent. copper rose 0.1 percent to $5,669 per ton. housing starts and michigan consumer sentiment reports are scheduled to come out in the u.s. on friday. bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot overnight top news from bloomberg asian equity markets were mostly higher after the region shrugged off the negative wall street price action, where tech resumed its sell-off and participants pondered over the recent fed rate hike as well as ongoing political woes. asx 200 (+0.1%) and nikkei 225 (+0.8%) gained from the open, with exporter names in the latter underpinned by a weaker currency. shanghai comp. (-0.3%) and hang seng (+0.3%) were mixed with the mainland underperforming as a firm liquidity operation by the pboc, was overshadowed by credit bubble concerns. 10yr jgbs were relatively flat with some marginal upside seen throughout the session, while today's boj policy decision also provided no fresh insights with the bank sticking to its policy framework. pboc injected cny 30bin in 7-day reverse repos, cny 160bin in 14-day reverse repos and cny 100bin in 28-day reverse repos, for a net weekly injection of cny 410bin vs. prey. net drain of cny 10bin last week boj kept rates unchanged at -0.1% as expected and maintained qqe with yield curve control as expected via 7¬2 votes. boj maintained annual pace of jgb holdings at jpy 80tin and to target 10yr yields at around 0%, while it also kept its economic assessment unchanged in which it stated that the economy turned to moderate expansion. top asian news european markets have seemingly shrugged off a hawkish, busy week, trading in the green throughout morning trade. individual stock news has contributed to the bullish open, with positive pre-market figures for tesco, alongside may's eu new car registrations bolstering the automobile names. the tech and energy sectors outperform, with the former supported by the late buying seen in the us tech names yesterday and the latter has been supported by some oil buying from the usd 44/bbl level. materials trade in the red following continued selling as a result of yesterday's reports stating that south african miners will need to be 30% back owned. fixed income markets have grinded lower as a result of the risk on sentiment, with some european unification evident, as greece is said to have reached a bailout deal with creditors with the full disbursement expected at the beginning of july. the biggest mover in the bond markets has been greek paper, with the 2y trading at its lowest yield level since october 15, further the greece/germany loy spread heading for 532bps then 519bps again top european news in currencies , the bloomberg dollar spot index fell 0.1 percent, after rising 0.5 percent on thursday to snap three days of losses. the yen fell 0.4 percent to 111.34 per dollar, after dropping 1.2 percent in the previous session, the most since january.  the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1175. a quiet morning in fx land, where we see meandering across the board. there was some early focus on the jpy pairs after the boj meeting stuck to the script, but through 111.00, the spot rate is starting to struggle a little with sellers coming in ahead of pre 112.00 offers. eur/usd has redressed some of the losses seen from the aftermath of the fomc meeting this week, with 'over-positioning' taking its toll with 1.1300 a near term line in the sand. demand into the lower half of the 1.1100's has supported for now, with a tentative move on 1.1200 in the making. eur/gbp is trying to base out also, but is struggling against buyers in cable who take their lead of the hawkish reflections from the boe vote split yesterday. 1.2800 looks to be well protected in the meantime, but expect pre 0.8800 to also garner some interest as range trading looks to be the order of the day for the most part. in commodities, headlines have been thin on the ground this week, with traders taking their cue from the longer-term backdrop(s). this has been headlined by the ongoing drift lower in oil prices, with recoveries mute as this broad-based selling interest is deterring bargain hunters for now. this looks to be the only major catalyst for a sustained move higher, but with wti staying below usd45, a move towards usd40 is now widely anticipated. metals prices have been mixed, but looking at copper, we see upside levels also contained, with the foray through usd2.60 short lived. on the day, zinc is outperforming and showing a 1.0%+ gain on the day. gold prices look to have further to go on the downside if you believe the usd is set to recoup further ground. technically, usd1225-30 is the next major support point to watch for. looking at the day ahead, we’ll receive the may housing starts and building permits data as well as the may labour market conditions index, before ending the week with the flash june university of michigan consumer sentiment reading. we’ll also hear from the fed’s kaplan this evening while eu finance ministers are again due to meet in luxembourg to discuss economic policy coordination and surveillance. it’s worth noting that on sunday france will complete the election of its new national assembly with a second round of voting where macron is expected to achieve a comfortable legislative majority. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap it was a twin move lower for markets yesterday as both bonds and equities sold off. with a more hawkish than expected fed still very much the focus 10y treasury yields closed last night up nearly 4bps at 2.165% after touching a low of 2.101% on wednesday morning immediately following the soft inflation data. yields are now back to within 4bps of where they were prior to that inflation data. across the curve, after testing the recent lows in spread, the 2y10y spread was also 2bps higher yesterday at 81bps. it was a similar story in europe with bunds (+5.6bps) and oats (+4.5bps) also making near complete u-turns with european supply congestion also playing a part. meanwhile it was a weak day for global equities but the s&p 500 (4th down day in 5) pared bigger losses near the open to only close -0.22%. the underperforming nasdaq (-0.47%) did the same and has now retraced -2.47% in the last week. the stoxx 600 (-0.39%) and dax (-0.89%) also finished in the red not helped by a fairly soft day for commodities. wti oil (-0.60%) extended declines further below $45/bbl while a softer day for gold (-0.55%), copper (-0.67%) and aluminium (-0.56%) all put pressure on commodity producers. however the big story yesterday in markets was the boe meeting. a slightly more hawkish than expected tone saw gilt yields rise sharply with the 10y rising 10.6bps to 1.029% and more or less completely reversing wednesday’s rally. sterling also rallied as much as +0.81% from its lows although it finished the day little changed. as expected, the mpc voted in favour of holding current policy steady however by a more marginal 5-3 split. that meant that 2 members joined kristin forbes in voting for a hike – michael saunders and ian mccafferty. db’s mark wall had been of the view going into the meeting that the mix of data – including the aggravated household real income squeeze via the continuation of accelerating cpi inflation and slowing wage inflation – could see the boe adopt less hawkish rhetoric, however the opposite happened. instead the boe was more hawkish than expected and the risks of a rate hike have increased. that said mark does not think that this surprisingly hawkish outcome means a rate hike is more likely than not. indeed he notes that how this 5-3 split resolves itself will depend on three things. first, economic momentum. any sense of disappointment should entrench the majority. second, the inflation overshoot. more relevant here is wages than sterling and pass-through. the government’s response to (public sector) pay could be particularly important for how this element of the boe dilemma resolves. the third point is whether or not the replacements for forbes and hogg are hawks. since this was forbes’ last meeting the vote being carried forward is a less hawkish 5-2. this will make any upcoming boe speeches important to keep an eye on. prior to the boe we also got may retail sales data in the uk yesterday. like wednesday’s wages data the numbers were disappointing with sales including fuel falling more than expected (-1.2% mom vs. -0.8% expected) resulting in the annual rate dropping to just +0.9% yoy from +4.2%. there was similarly disappointing data for sales excluding fuel. staying with the uk for a second, it’s worth highlighting that yesterday we got confirmation that brexit talks will begin on monday with david davis and michel barnier due to open formal negotiations in brussels. on top of that the uk government confirmed yesterday  that it will press ahead with the state opening of parliament next wednesday. sky news was reporting yesterday that a deal between the conservatives and dup was “95% done”. before we go any further we’ve got the final big central bank meeting of the week to recap this morning with the boj having just wrapped up. as expected the boj kept monetary policy on hold while also sticking to its pledge to keep 10y jgb yields around zero. the ¥80tn target on jgb purchases was also maintained. the bank also used its policy statement to reiterate that japan’s economy “has been turning toward a moderate expansion”. the bank was also upbeat on consumption but there was no mention of any exit guidance, which will likely be the focus of kuroda’s press conference due to start now. the nikkei and topix are +0.53% and +0.52% respectively although those gains came prior to the meeting outcome and supported by a weaker yen (-0.22%) while jgb yields are little moved (10y around 0.048%). bourses elsewhere in asia are mixed with the hang seng (+0.29%) and asx (+0.33%) up but the shanghai comp (-0.17%) and kospi (-0.05%) weaker. moving on. away from the boe the other notable update in europe yesterday was the news that greece and its creditors have reached a deal on the next stages of its bailout following a finance ministers meeting in luxembourg last night. a eurogroup statement after the meeting stated that the deal “paves the way for a successful completion of the second review of the ecm programme” and that a disbursement of €8.5bn is expected to be approved, helping to remove some of the concerns around a heavy debt repayment schedule next month. the deal is expected to include further deferral of efsf interest and amortization by up to 15 years. the key sticking point over debt relief remains however and while the imf has agreed to join in principle, a final decision on debt relief is not expected until next year. the imf’s lagarde confirmed last night that the deal “allows us to lock in the gains made by greece in its reforms and it allows for more time for negotiations to be concluded on the required debt relief”. away from this, there was a fair bit of data released in the us yesterday and which in summary was mostly a mixed bag. most of it was focused on the factory sector. notable was the softer than expected industrial production reading for may (0.0% mom vs. +0.2% expected) following a +1.1% reading in april (revised up one-tenth). capacity utilization also slipped one-tenth to 76.6% while manufacturing production was revealed as falling -0.4% mom (vs. +0.1% expected). june data was a bit more optimistic however. the empire manufacturing reading rose 20.8pts to 19.8 and well ahead of expectations (5.0 expected) – it was also the best reading since september 2014. meanwhile the philly fed manufacturing index slipped 11.2pts but still came in at an elevated and better than expected 27.6 (vs. 24.9 expected). away from this the nahb housing market index for june declined 2pts to 67. initial jobless claims fell a further 8k last week to 237k while finally the import price index reading for may fell -0.3% mom reflecting some of the weakness in energy prices. looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe the main focus will be on the final may cpi readings for the

253,What Everyone Will Ask Kuroda Today: Why Has The BOJ Has Already Tapered QE By 45%?,2017-06-16 00:23:00+00:00,"unlike wednesday's fomc decision, few are excited about tonight's boj announcement in which kuroda is expected to announce no changes; in fact the biggest mystery is what time the ""fluid"" meeting will take place. what little suspense there is in kuroda's remarks, will likely be confined to his comments during the press conference about the boj's exit strategy. for those who plan to stay up in hope of catching some of the usdjpy volatility upon the boj announcement, here is a recap of what to expect from bofa: we expect the bank of japan to remain on hold at its 16 june monetary policy meeting (mpm), keeping both its targets for rates and risk asset purchases unchanged . we also think the policy board will retain the ""about ¥80tn"" guideline for jgb purchases and refrain from announcing official tapering out of concern that doing so may send an unintentionally hawkish message to the markets . the central bank has every reason to be cautious. growth has been running well above potential in 1h17, but price pressures remain weak, with boj-style core inflation (cpi ex fresh food and energy) languishing at 0.0% as of april. downside risks to the inflation outlook suggest the boj is nowhere close to hiking rates or shrinking its balance sheet. however, with the media and some members of parliament expressing increased interest in the boj's ""exit strategy"", we believe it will be a focal topic at governor kuroda's post-mpm press conference . but we doubt he will say anything new. the governor will likely remain cautious in his communications, reiterating that the central bank is not yet considering specific plans, given the 2% inflation target remains a long way away. the sankei shimbun recently reported that the boj board will consider upgrading its overall assessment of the economy at the 20 july mpm, when it updates its estimate of the output gap in the next quarterly outlook report. however, risks to the board's fy17 japan-style core inflation forecast of 1.4%yoy are tilted firmly to the downside, in our view, especially if commodity prices stay at current levels . another downgrade to the board's cpi forecasts seems likely in july, or by the october mpm at the latest. in our view, the last thing the boj wants to do in this situation is to signal policy tightening. in the absence of policy changes, the focus will be on governor kuroda's post-mpm press conference, scheduled for 3:30pm jst. we expect the q&a to be dominated by two themes: (1) the boj's latest stance on an exit strategy from ultra-accommodative monetary policy and (2) the seeming contradiction between the policy board's commitment to increase its jgb holdings at an annual rate of ""about ¥80tn"" and the ongoing slowdown in the central bank's bond purchases, which we now estimate is running at about ¥60tn. but before we get into bofa's discussion of these two topics, it is worth reminding readers of something we first noted three months ago : the boj is quietly engaging in stealth tapering of its qe, for the same reason that the ecb will have no choice but to taper its own purchases - it is running out of eligible bonds to buy. in a report by jpm, the bank calculates that in may, the bank of japan bought just yen7.89 trillion ($71.6 billion) worth of japanese government bonds. this was the the least outright buying since october 2014, when the central bank surprised markets by saying it would increase its asset purchases. since launching its own version of qqe (before it twisted into yield control), the central bank has kept in place its target of increasing bond holdings each year by ""about"" yen80 trillion. however, at the current rate of buying, the wsj writes, the holdings are set to rise this year by only about yen55 trillion. the central bank is "" technically tapering ,"" said hiroshi shiraishi, senior economist at bnp paribas in tokyo. this can be clearly seen in the following chart from bank of america. aside from the a declining supply of bonds held by the private sector, one tactical reason why the boj may be buying fewer bonds is its ""yield curve control"" policy, which aims to keep the yield on 10-year government bonds at zero. this implies it can buy fewer bonds when the yield is close to that target. wednesday, the yield was at 0.06%. previously, kuroda has acknowledged this slowdown, but has been quick to declare that what effectively amounts to a 35% taper doesn't signal a retreat from easy-money policies. ""at this stage, we are not exiting,"" kuroda said at the wall street journal's ceo council meeting in tokyo on may 16. yes but what happens when the boj officially announces the need to start tapering? and more importantly, what will be the reaction of the market, which has so far taken the ""technical tapering"" in stride, in the country where the central bank already owns over 43% of all japanese government bonds, and where the boj's balance sheet is 90% of gdp? so, here is bank of america again explaining what kuroda will likely respond if and when asked about (1) the boj's latest stance on an exit strategy from ultra-accommodative monetary policy and (2) the seeming contradiction between the policy board's commitment to increase its jgb holdings at an annual rate of ""about ¥80tn"" and the ongoing slowdown in the central bank's bond purchases, which we now estimate is running at about ¥60tn. we think governor kuroda's communications will remain cautious in response to both issues. attention on the boj's exit strategy has increased since bloomberg reported in an 8 june article that the boj was considering ""re-calibrating its communications to acknowledge that it is thinking about how to handle a future exit from monetary stimulus, without giving the impression that this is on the agenda anytime soon."" at the same time, opposition lawmakers have raised greater concerns over the boj's financial health when the central bank eventually raises interest rates and have pressed the central bank to disclose detailed exit plans and its associated costs . while the bloomberg article did not contain any new information, in our opinion, it ended up causing some volatility in the markets, suggesting investors will remain sensitive to governor kuroda's comments. for this reason, we think the governor will likely say very little on the subject. on slowing jgb purchases, governor kuroda is likely to acknowledge-as he has in recent diet hearings-that the rate of increase in the central bank's jgb holdings has recently fallen to around ¥60tn on an annualized basis. however, we expect the governor to stress that the slowdown in jgb purchases does not reflect intentional ""tapering"" but reflects an automatic adjustment mechanism under yield curve control (ycc ). in other words, the slowdown in boj bond buying is a result of reduced upward pressure on jgb yields, reflecting a fall in us rates. in other words, kuroda will hope that the boj's communication remains on autopilot. still, at a time when the fed just laid out what its balance sheet normalization would look like, and when even the ecb has ""trial ballooned"" it will soon follow, the discussion will inevitably turn to the most sensitive topic facing not only the boj, but japan itself: how does the central bank hope to reduce its gargantuan balance sheet, which recently surpassed that of the fed. here is bofa's answer: the boj has continued purchasing significant amounts of jgbs for over four years under its qqe policy, and consequently its balance sheet has ballooned to over ¥500tn, comparable in size to japan's gdp . various side effects have emerged. since the beginning of 2016, the boj has carried out more jgb lending through securities lending facility operations, a sign that the market shortage of jgbs has become more serious. moreover, the repo rate plunged near the end of fy16 (march 2017) due to strong demand for tbs. recently, the boj has reduced its purchases of short- and medium-term jgbs, so its securities lending facility operations have also dwindled. the rise of short- and medium-term yields shows supply-demand has eased somewhat. however, if investor demand (and not necessarily such strong demand) turns to jgbs again, the risk is rising that supply-demand will tighten and prices will be distorted. naturally the boj knows this very well, so last year it introduced yield curve control (ycc) as a step on the way to making monetary policy more sustainable. so far the boj has succeeded at maintaining yields near targeted levels, and it has quite smoothly reduced its jgb purchases. the year-on-year increase in the boj's holdings of jgbs has declined to about ¥70tn, well below the guideline figure of ¥80tn . if the current purchasing pace is maintained, yoy growth in holdings will decline even more . the boj's gross annual purchases amount to about ¥96tn now, and at the end of may it held ¥43tn of jgbs that were set to be redeemed within one year, so its net purchasing pace is around ¥53tn now . for five months from january to may 2017, the boj increased its jgb holdings by ¥30tn, and if the current purchasing pace is maintained, its jgb holdings should increase by about ¥60tn in 2017. whatever explanation kuroda comes up with , the reality is that the ""liquidity impulse "" generated from purchasing ¥53tn vs the designated ¥80tn, represents a greater than 30% reduction . and sooner or later, the market will realize that the liquidity added to the market by the boj is nearly half of what it should be in theory . that moment could result in a rude awakening, as it will likely come as the fed continues to tighten its own monetary policy with the ecb potentially starting to tighten too as it is about to run out of eligible bunds to buy . so how will the boj proceed? here, again, is bofa: we think the boj will find it difficult to change policy for the time being, so the jgb market's volatility might stay low for a while . however, as the economic recovery deepens and domestic inflation picks up, it would not be surprising to us if the boj increased its communications with the market and put more effort into forming a consensus about its exit from qqe. of course, it will proceed cautiously to avoid sudden yield surges and yen appreciation . if some conditions are fulfilled-inflation rises to about 1% and the fed and ecb proceed steadily towards monetary normalization-it is possible the boj shifts from excessive easing to a more sustainable monetary policy even if its exit lies well in the future (the boj's public and private face). one risk is that an unexpected event triggers global risk avoidance leading to lower yields and a simultaneous round of yen appreciation. for example, even if the 10yr yield fell far below its target, a reduction in jgb purchases could prompt further strengthening of the yen. steering this course would not be easy. in that case, the boj would probably need to take countermeasures such as setting a minimum yield and continuing with its purchase operations. finally, here is bank of america's take on what the boj's action could mean for the yen: the boj is widely expected to leave its policy unchanged, and the fed's stance and us data will be the predominant concern for the usd/jpy. we believe the boj is careful about not sending the wrong signal about a policy exit when the financial market is questioning the strength of the us and chinese economies, and japanese inflation measures are hovering around 0%. instead, the market is likely to focus on upcoming us data to judge if the fed is right about its policy normalization plan, forcing the market to catch up, or the fed has to adjust toward the dovish market expectation. we argued that self-sustained usd strength may need more time to materialize such that japanese equities may be a better position for now. in fact, our us strategists argue it could take a few more months to know whether the us will reform its tax system. we prefer being long nzd/jpy for now while we fundamentally remain constructive on usd/jpy . in short, for now the boj remains on autopilot, which is why don't expect much from today's boj announcement. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Bank of America Bank of America Japan Yield Curve Volatility Rude Awakening Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Yen Bond CPI recovery Output Gap Reality,1
283,"""It's A Perfect Storm Of Negativity"" - Veteran Trader Rejoins The Dark Side",2017-06-15 14:57:00+00:00,"authored by kevin muir via the macro tourist blog, after many months of fighting all the naysayers predicting the next big stock market crash, i am finally succumbing to the seductive story of the dark side, and getting negative on equities. i am often early, so maybe this means the rally is about to accelerate to the upside. i am willing to take that chance. it would be just like me to pound the table on the long side, and then abandon the trade right before it goes parabolic. but when i examine the current environment, i worry the credit expansion wave that has been dragging stocks higher is about to crest. before i go into my reasons for switching sides, let’s take a moment to remember how we got here. i’ve been bullish for a while. not because i thought things were well in the world. no, i was bullish for almost the opposite reason. as i stared at the massive expansion in the ecb, bank of japan and swiss national bank’s balance sheets, i thought there was no point in standing in front of the monetary expansion freight train. the amount of printing by these banks was truly staggering. we have become somewhat numb to these sorts of numbers, but a combined $14.5 trillion dollar central bank balance sheet is johnny depp crazy. for a while we had the perfect storm of good news. a new american president who promised tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal infrastructure spending. the ecb and the bank of japan were filling blue tickets as fast as their clerks received fills. the federal reserve was tightening, but they had not yet pulled out any pink tickets for their inventory, and it appeared the us economy would be able to weather slightly higher rates. stocks exploded higher. even with some very accomplished hedge fund veterans preaching caution, the price just kept rallying in their face. the more bearish they got, the more it rallied. but over the past few months, slowly the story broke down. the president, once revered by wall street, failed to pass his health reform legislation, which pushed the tax cuts further into the future. shortly thereafter it became obvious the much salivated infrastructure stimulus would also be difficult to pass through congress. almost overnight, the president become more of a liability for us equities than an elixir. yet stocks kept rising. even in the face of troubling political news from president trump, us stocks pushed to new highs. almost makes you think the rally had nothing to do with trump in the first place. and maybe it didn’t. maybe it is as simple as the ecb and bank of japan’s batshit crazy money printing overwhelming the financial markets. look at the chart of the combined balance sheet for the fed, boj and ecb closely. the acceleration is mind boggling. you don’t throw that sort of liquidity into the global financial system and not expect it to have an effect. it’s actually surprising that stocks didn’t run even farther. yet stock markets are forward discounting mechanisms. although the ecb has not yet signaled a taper, the writing is on the wall. like a child playing musical chairs, markets are eyeing the exit with a worrisome determination. everyone knows the next move for the ecb is to reduce stimulus, it’s only a question of timing. as for the bank of japan, even crazy kuroda is putting out feelers for the slowing down of stimulus. the rate of balance sheet expansion for the ecb and boj has peaked for the time being. this might be enough on its own to cause stocks to pause. but when you combine it with fed policy, it becomes clear that the punch bowl has been removed, and it’s time to go home. when i wrote my piece yesterday about yellen being more of a hawk than the common narrative suggested, sam gruen from lightfield capital messaged me to say that although the federal reserve has a dual mandate, some fomc members have adopted an unofficial third mandate - financial conditions. here is sam explaining it in his own words: overall agree with the view in your piece, but i think it’s been quite clear in communications since the gfc that the fed has actually three targets, inflation, employment and financial conditions. i think people like dudley have been the most vocal proponents of this third goal. my view of the fed since janet took over is the capacity to look through inflation dynamics as long as employment is still growing since they still view stuff through the phillips curve but to overweight changes in financial conditions in the short term. if you don’t follow sam, then you should get right on it . although i intuitively realized the fed was more apt to ease when markets were in turmoil, i didn’t put together that the opposite was also true. the fed was more likely to tighten when financial conditions were easy. have a look at the chart of financial conditions over the past few years: when financial conditions plummet, the fed eases up on the brakes. and when financial conditions accelerate, the fed presses down harder. but what are financial conditions? here is a screen shot of what goes into the bloomberg calculation. it’s a combination of credit spreads, stock prices and volatility measures. basically, all the things that are positive correlated to the stock market. so when the critics complain about the fed supporting the stock market in moments of weakness, they have a point. yet they are missing the fact that the fed is also targeting the stocks when they rise. i have become convinced the fed will continue to tighten and wind down their balance sheet until financial conditions retreat. in the meantime, the us economy is rolling over. the citibank economic surprise index keeps hitting new lows: and credit growth is collapsing. here is a terrific chart from tim duy : and the bond market is screaming that the economy is about to slow down. the us 2/10 year treasury spread is below 80 bps. inflation breakevens are plummeting. there are a million other little signs the us economy is rolling over, but that’s not important. what is important is the realization that until financial conditions back up, the fed will not ease off the brake. to top it all off, the fed is not only braking, but they are also preparing the market for a balance sheet unwind. this is like qe in reverse. it’s a perfect storm of negativity. an overly tight fed that is determined to withdraw monetary stimulus even in the face of a declining economy. there are a bunch of different trades that will arise from these developments, but at the end of the day, the fed will keep removing stimulus until financial conditions retreat. why fight them? given the fact that the ecb and boj are more likely to also slow down their stimulus rather than increase, global liquidity will be going down in the coming months. stocks have a tough time rising without liquidity. i am shorting us stocks with the idea of covering them into a retreat of financial conditions that forces the fed to change their tune. i have been waiting for quite a while to rejoin the dark side, i think it’s finally time. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Japan Federal Reserve Volatility 10 Year Treasury Bank of Japan Musical Chairs Bond Market Crash Citibank Swiss National Bank,1

with both auctions relatively well digested by the market. top european news in currencies, it was a quiet start to london trade in the aftermath of the fomc announcements last night, where the 25bp hike was followed up with details on balance sheet reduction as well as a generally upbeat tone on growth, inflation and the labour markets. the overall impact was to redress some of the overly bearish usd sentiment, which has been justified on valuation levels against some of its major counterparts, but perhaps a little too zealously in the time frame(s) achieved. eur/usd has been on the back foot this morning and has now slipped back under 1.1200, but as we noted yesterday, strong demand anticipated in the 1.1150-60 area, and if not then from 1.1120 again lower down. we have also seen usd/jpy gravitating somewhat nervously back towards 110.00 again, and we can only put this down to the lofty levels on wall street, which will have been perturbed by a fed intent on maintaining the normalisation path. for gbp, it has not been a good week based on politics alone, but on the data front it is not much better, as the slightly higher than expected inflation read on tuesday was followed up by a drop off in wage growth yesterday while retail sales fell more than expected in this morning's release. this was marginally offset by prior revisions, but coming up is the boe announcement, and it is hard to see past a cautious mpc have little alternative but to account for the fresh uncertainty propagated by theresa may's snap election and the unnerving end result. in commodities, given the focus on political and central bank risks of late, the commodities markets have taken a backseat to a larger degree, but standout losses in oil prices have been prominent, with the wti taking out usd45.00 on the downside and showing no signs of giving up on even lower levels. on the week, the api build in crude stocks was the first surprise, added to by the doe draw which was smaller than expected. amid the backdrop of growing us shale production, the prospect of a test towards usd40.00 looks ever likely, but there is a strong level of support to contend with down here. still no change in the brent premium, which has remained uniform inside usd2.00-2.50. copper prices have slipped again noticably, making the breach of usd2.60 an all to brief affair, but elsewhere, we see zinc and lead showing 1.0% gains on the day, while nickel is now flat. gold was choppy over the fomc last night, having raced up to usd1280 on the post data (inflation/retail sales) usd hit, but is now hovering in the low usd1260's with silver still camped below usd17.00. looking at the day ahead, we’ll kick off with the import price index reading for may, followed then by the latest weekly initial jobless claims print and philly fed manufacturing index for june. following that we then get industrial and manufacturing production for may before finishing with the nahb housing market index reading for june. us event calendaar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap plenty to get through today but only one place to start and that is with the fed. as widely expected a 25bp hike in the fed funds rate was delivered lifting the target range to 1.00% to 1.25%. there were no real surprises in the dots either. the 2017 and 2018 median dots were left unchanged at 1.375% and 2.125% respectively implying one further rate hike this year (although 4 members expect 2 more hikes and another 4 members expect no more hikes). the 2019 median dot was rounded down marginally to 2.9375% while the longer run dot was left unchanged at 3%. all the talk though was about the relatively upbeat tone in the fomc statement, particularly in light of the soft cpi data earlier in the day, a continuation of a somewhat hawkish tone by fed chair yellen in the postmeeting press conference and finally some of the details released around the process of rolling-off the balance sheet. touching on those points in some sort of order, there were two notable takeaways from the fomc statement initially. the first was the slightly more upbeat description of economic activity and the second was the acknowledgement that “inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2% in the near term but to stabilize around the committee’s 2% objective over the medium term”. in the press conference yellen added to this by saying that “we continue to feel that with a strong labour market and a labour market that’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up”. as a reminder this followed what was a pretty soft may inflation report released a few hours earlier. both headline (-0.1% mom vs. 0.0% expected) and core (+0.1% mom vs. +0.2% expected) cpi missed which in  turn pushed the annual rates down to +1.9% yoy (from +2.2%) and +1.7% yoy (from +1.9%) respectively. the yoy rate for the core is now the lowest since may 2015. the fed chair sought to downplay the data in her press conference by saying that its important “not to overreact to a few readings” and also that the data can be noisy, while indicating that the recent prints also appear to be the result of one-off factors. in summary, despite having the opportunity to do so, it didn’t feel like the fed sounded particularly concerned on the inflation front. in terms of the balance sheet the most notable development was the fomc announcing the decision to likely proceed with the balance sheet wind down later this year. specifically, the statement revealed that “the committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated”. there were further details also released which provided some guidance as to the process that the fed expects to take. in summary the initial cap will be set at $10bn a month of which $6bn will be from treasuries and $4bn from mbs. the caps will then increase every three months by $6bn for treasuries until they reach $30bn and $4bn for mbs until they reach $20bn. once they hit their maximum run off the fed then expects that “holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and predictable manner until the committee judges that the fed is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy effectively and efficiently”. so where to now? our us economics team have concluded that their expectations for fed policy for the rest of this year are unchanged post the meeting. that is they continue to expect a formal announcement about unwinding the balance sheet at the september meeting, to start in october. they also expect a pause in the rate hiking cycle in september, followed by another rate hike in december, assuming that the economy evolves in line with the fed’s expectations. they add that it is possible for the fed to both raise rates and announce a shift in its balance sheet policy at the same meeting if the economy, labour market, and (most importantly) inflation surprise to the upside. but recent inflation data have raised the bar for such surprises. you can read more in their report here. over in markets the most significant move initially came after the soft inflation data. 10y treasury yields plunged as much as 11bps to hit an intraday low of 2.101% and the usd sold-off as much as -0.78% from its highs. while the greenback made a near-complete u-turn post the fomc to finish little changed on the day treasury yields only edged a couple of basis points off their lows. 10y treasuries still finished the day 8.5bps lower in yield at 2.126% for the lowest close since november last year. the curve flattened fairly dramatically too. the 2s10s spread tightened over 5bps to 79bps and is now at the tightest since september 1st. as a reminder this was as high as 136bps in december. the low in 2016 was 75bps and should it tighten below that, then it will hit the lowest spread since 2007. the 5s30s spread of 105bps is only a smidgen off the ytd lows too. it’s worth noting that oil tumbled -3.72% yesterday and below $45/bbl following the latest inventory data which didn’t go unnoticed for bond  markets. meanwhile the s&p 500 finished a choppy session down -0.10% with the energy sector underperforming, while the nasdaq (-0.41%) underperformed once again and fell for the third time in the last four sessions. all that to look forward to but before we get there, this morning in asia equity markets have mostly followed the lead from wall street in falling into the red. the nikkei (-0.43%), hang seng (-0.90%), kospi (-0.62%) and asx (-1.12%) are all weaker with energy and commodity-sensitive names most under pressure. bourses in china are little changed while us equity index futures are also slightly in the red. sovereign bond markets have rallied with the antipodeans in particular around 5bps lower in yield. in fx the aussie dollar (+0.58%) has been the big outperformer following better than expected employment numbers in australia this morning. back to yesterday. the other notable data release in the us was the may retail sales report. the data was also disappointing with headline sales falling unexpectedly (-0.3% mom vs. 0.0% expected) – the biggest one month decline since january 2016 - and ex auto and gas sales flat versus expectations for a +0.3% mom rise. the control group (0.0% mom vs. +0.3% expected) also missed although there was a reasonable upward revision to the april reading. away from that business inventories in april fell -0.2% mom as expected. in the uk the remaining employment data revealed that the ilo unemployment rate held steady at 4.6% in april while the claimant count rose 7k for the third consecutive monthly increase. elsewhere in europe cpi for germany in may was confirmed at -0.2% mom and +1.4% yoy (unrevised from the initial flash reading) while industrial production for the euro area was confirmed as rising +0.5% mom, bang in line with the consensus. european bond yields moved in tow with treasuries following that soft us cpi data. 10y bund yields finished the day down 4.0bps at 0.223% while oats were 2.5bps lower at 0.579%. it was the move for gilts which stood out however with the rally clearly supported by that soft wage growth number. 10y gilt yields plummeted 10.7bps to 0.927%, the lowest level since october last year and the biggest one-day rally since december 2nd. looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe we’ll receive the final may cpi reports for both france and italyfollowed by may retail sales data in the uk (core retail sales expected to decline -1.0% mom). following that we’ll get the april trade balance for the euro area before attention turns over to the aforementioned boe policy rate decision at midday. this afternoon in the us there are a number of reports due out. we’ll kick off with the import price index reading for may, followed then by the latest weekly initial jobless claims print and philly fed manufacturing index for june. following that we then get industrial and manufacturing production for may before finishing with the nahb housing market index reading for june. away from that we’ll also get the snb rate decision today, while another event to keep an eye on is the euro area finance ministers meeting in luxembourg where debt relief for greece is expected to be discussed. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [

299,Cudmore: Yellen Just Made A Big Mistake,2017-06-15 11:00:00+00:00,"one of the lingering questions to emerge from yesterday's fomc meeting, after yellen's ""first dovish, then hawkish"" statement rocked the dollar and markets, is whether the fed chair has some more accurate way of forecasting inflation than the rest of market to justify her optimistic outlook, and to explain why the divergence between the fed's dot plot and the market's own ff forecasts is nearly 100%. and, if not, is the fed about to make another major policy mistake by forecasting a far stronger economy than is possible, culminating with a recession. according to bloomberg's mark cudmore, the answer is that while yellen is desperate to infuse confidence in the market, the fed, which ""hasn’t been correct for seven years"", remains as clueless as ever, which is why the fed's hawkishness is actually a signal to buy long-end bonds, which will add to further curve tightening and ultimately precipitate the next recession. put otherwise, "" if yellen had acknowledged that the policy frameworks she and her colleagues have been using since the crisis have all been incorrect, then we might believe she has a chance of now applying a more appropriate framework and has a credible plan to sustainably hit the inflation target . instead, traders can’t help but feel that no lessons are being learned and will have to raise the probability of a major policy mistake in market pricing. this means that the yield curve will need to flatten further through long-end yields dropping."" in simple words: the fed has just brought the next recession that much closer, which shouldn't come as a surprise.  as we showed before, every fed tightening akways ends with a recession . the only question is when. from marc cudmore's latest macro view. fed’s hawkishness is negative for long-end yields it may seem counter-intuitive but the fed’s optimistic perspective on the u.s. economy makes it more likely that 10-year treasury yields have more downside.  the problem for janet yellen is that the data is there for us all to see: what few inflation pressures did exist are now receding rapidly. by failing to comprehensively address the fact that the committee’s projections are constantly over-optimistic, they further undermine their own credibility. the fed hasn’t been correct for seven years . the evidence would suggest their models are broken. yellen still cites the phillips curve even though some of her own committee have questioned its validity and it has shown no sign of working as anticipated in recent years. temporary factors are cited as the reason for low inflation - for example a decline in mobile phone bills - without acknowledging that the technological innovation frequently behind such factors isn’t a temporary phenomenon. technology is also helping drive down external inflationary pressures coming through from commodity prices . and the committee’s models don’t seem to adequately account for demographic disinflationary impulses either. if yellen had acknowledged that the policy frameworks she and her colleagues have been using since the crisis have all been incorrect, then we might believe she has a chance of now applying a more appropriate framework and has a credible plan to sustainably hit the inflation target. instead, traders can’t help but feel that no lessons are being learned and will have to raise the probability of a major policy mistake in market pricing . this means that the yield curve will need to flatten further through long-end yields dropping. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Yield Curve Janet Yellen Recession,1

334,"The Fed's Balance Sheet Reduction Schedule, In Yellen's Words",2017-06-14 19:51:00+00:00,"earlier, we laid out how , in theory, the fed's balance sheet unwind plan will work according to the fomc: the fed will trim reinvestments in tsys at a rate of $6bn/month initially, and mbs at $4bn/month, or a total of $10bn/month, and will increase the reinvestment caps in steps of $10bn ($6tsy+$4mbs) at 3 month intervals over 12 months until it reaches a total 50bn per month. shortly thereafter yellen confirmed that the fed expects to implement a balance sheet reduction plan this year; not just announce it, suggesting either a september or december taper start, unless something ""changes"" of course. here is the explanation, straight from yellen's mouth, as laid out in the press conference following the fed announcement: ""initially, these caps will be set at relatively low levels, $6 billion per month for treasuries and $4 billion per month for agencies. so any proceeds exceeding those amounts would be reinvested. these caps will gradually rise over the course of a year to maximums of $30 billion per month for treasuries and $20 billion per month for agency securities, and will remain in place through the normalization process."" the fed believes that with this approach to limit the volume of securities, ""private investors will have to absorb as we reduced our holdings, the caps should guard against outsize moves in interest rates and other potential market strains."" ""i can't tell you what the longer run normal level of reserve balances will be because that will depend on the committee's eventual decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the longer run, as well as a number of as-yet unknown elements, including the banking system's future demand for reserves, and various factors that may affect the daily supply of reserves ."" it is worth noting that, in the q&a, yellen also said that the fed's ""normalization"" plan is contingent on the economy and other factors, so it will most likely change. in the first question, a reporter asked "" the principles you released today say the balance sheet wind down should commence once interest rate normalization is well under way. would this latest rate increase, with this increase, do you believe normalization is now well under way ?"" yellen answers: "" so that is something that we have said for some time, and i've previously, when i've been asked what well under way means, said that i don't want to define that in purely quantitative terms, but rather in qualitative terms. so there is no specific level of the federal funds rate that means we are well under way ."" the message: the fed is not yet ready to signal a specific time this year when implementation might begin. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Monetary Policy,1
335,"Fed Reveals Balance Sheet ""Normalization"" Schedule: Will Reduce Reinvestments By $10BN/Month",2017-06-14 19:33:00+00:00,"coming in earlier than many expected, the fed for the first time laid out how it plans to ""normalize"" its balance sheet which it expects to reduce by trimming reinvestments in tsys at a rate of $6bn/month initially, and mbs at $4bn/month, or a total of $10bn/month, and will increase the reinvestment caps in steps of 10bn at 3 month intervals over 12 months until it reaches a total 50bn per month. indicatively this is well below goldman's expectation of $10bn and $5bn initial caps for tsys and mbs, as we showed over the weekend . as its said in the addendum to the materials, “the committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated” with directions to read a policy addendum. as the fed further explains, the reinvestment cap will hit tsys at the tune of $6bn per month initially, and mbs at $4bn: this level of detail provided is the main surprise so far and what traders are most focused on, because as citi notes, it as moving forward the chances for a balance sheet announcement from december. more questions on how soon implementation would follow. commenting on the fed's unwind schedule, bmo's ian lyngen writes that the fed positions itself for september/december tapering. it notes that the fed’s reinvestment tapering plan sets up the central bank to begin unwinding its balance sheet at either the september or december meeting. if the fed reaches the maximum $30b/month cap for treasuries (with a december start), this means $325b of ust tapering in 2018, amounting to “roughly half of a 25bp rate hike,” bmo says, using recent fed estimates indicatively, this is the significantly higher reinvestment cap schedule that goldman expected earlier: process for phasing out reinvestment: the may minutes signaled that the committee will preannounce a schedule of gradually increasing caps to limit the amounts of securities that can run off in any given month. our assumption is that that the initial caps are $10 billion a month for ust and $5 billion a month for mbs . the caps would rise each quarter by $10 billion and $5 billion to $40 billion and $20 billion respectively . caps allow for a gradual runoff and deal with the variability associated with mbs prepayment and the irregular monthly schedule of maturing assets. the caps will remain in place after the phase-in but then only bind in roughly a third of the months for treasuries until mid-2020 when the balance sheet reaches its projected terminal size. we will provide further details shortly for now, the full statement is below : all participants agreed to augment the committee's policy normalization principles and plans by providing the following additional details regarding the approach the fomc intends to use to reduce the federal reserve's holdings of treasury and agency securities once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. the committee intends to gradually reduce the federal reserve's securities holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal payments it receives from securities held in the system open market account. specifically, such payments will be reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps. gradually reducing the federal reserve's securities holdings will result in a declining supply of reserve balances. the committee currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis; the level will reflect the banking system's demand for reserve balances and the committee's decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the future. the committee expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet normalization. the committee affirms that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. however, the committee would be prepared to resume reinvestment of principal payments received on securities held by the federal reserve if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the committee's target for the federal funds rate. moreover, the committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Federal Reserve Monetary Policy System Open Market Account,1

350,"Axel Merk's 'Best Bubble Indicator' Is Setting Up For ""Major Shock""",2017-06-14 16:18:00+00:00,"authored by axel merk via merkinvestments.com, we increasingly see claims low volatility in the markets may be structural. even as we agree that some of the analyses we see make good points, we are concerned we may be setting ourselves up for a major shock. let me explain. before getting into the details about the current environment, let me make some general observations. in my experience, complacency, with its cousin low volatility, is the best bubble indicator i am aware of. perceived safety gets investors to pile into investments that they later regret. when it happens on a massive scale, major market distortions may be created that can lead to financial crises. and as the tech bubble that burst in 2000 shows, even if there is no systemic risk, the unwinding can be most painful to investors. in 2008, however, the perception that home prices always had to rise had become engrained in highly levered, yet illiquid, financial instruments, causing the unwinding to bring the global financial system to its knees. in our assessment, however, make no mistake about it: assuming for a moment the next crash won't take down a major bank, doesn't imply it cannot wipe out much more of your wealth than you ever anticipated. indeed, lower bank leverage is given as an argument as to why volatility is lower these days. except that the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008 - a period in which banks were extra-ordinarily levered - also showed low volatility in a variety of markets. it was the perceived safety, embodied by quasi-sophisticated value-at-risk (var) models that got risk managers at financial institutions to gear up. what could possibly go wrong, right? a more convincing argument i hear as to why low volatility is structural may be that information nowadays gets absorbed more quickly. on the one hand, we have computers scan the news in milliseconds, often trading without human intervention. and we have more computing power, allowing for a more efficient implementation of any investment process. market makers in exchange traded funds also help in the execution efficiency of markets, possibly exerting downward pressure on volatility. however, let's not forget that volatility lowered in this fashion may have the same implication as low volatility in the building up of any bubble: it is the perceived risk that is lower, not actual risk. machines are fantastic at certain aspects, be that keeping spreads tight in an exchange traded fund, or scanning twitter for keywords. trades initiated in this fashion provide liquidity to the markets, but that liquidity can evaporate rather quickly when the machines go off-line. let there be a glitch in the markets for whatever reason (say, someone dumps a large number of derivatives in off hours), and today's incarnation of automated traders tend to wait it out. in the meantime, stop loss orders of other market participants may be triggered, possibly causing flash crashes. one argument is that low volatility is due to a lack of economic surprises. we get emotional about elections, but when the economy is stuck in a low growth environment with few deviations, it only makes sense for markets to be less volatile as well. that may be the case, but in our assessment won’t stop from investors pushing asset prices to unsustainable levels on that backdrop. i have little doubt that a substantial driver of low volatility may be central banks. low interest rates and quantitative easing (qe) compress risk premia; in plain english, this means not only that junk bonds trade at a lower premium over treasuries, but that perceived risk is reduced in all markets, including equities, causing volatility to be lower. when central bankers ""do whatever it takes,"" it is no surprise that investors chase yield without being concerned about negative consequences. but when central bankers ""taper"" their purchases, odds are that volatility comes back as taper tantrums have shown. the same should be the case when the fed raises interest rates or ""normalizes"" its balance sheet. but wait: this hasn't happened, emboldening those who argue we have a structural change. with all due respect, i believe this is the wrong conclusion: in 2016, the fed was hostage of the markets. eager to raise rates, the folks at the fomc realized they could only raise rates if the market let them. any fed official will tell you they won't be held back from raising rates simply because equity prices might fall. indeed, any incoming fed chair (and we will have a newbie early next year) will take the job with the best of intentions, not be bossed around by the markets. except that falling equity prices are often associated with expanding risk premia, i.e. plunging junk bonds; that is, they are associated with deteriorating financial conditions. and the fed is always ready to respond to “deteriorating financial conditions.” you tell me what the difference is in an era of elevated asset prices. still, the market appeared to present the rate hike earlier this year on a silver platter. just as a bull market makes investors feel very smart, a rate hike where the wheels don't fall off the markets makes the guardians at the fed feel like they are doing their job properly. maybe so. i have a more somber interpretation: in hesitating so long to raise rates, the fed has fallen ever more behind the curve. sure, the fed may raise nominal rates, but real rates may continue to be low to negative. federal funds futures currently price in 2.5 more rate hikes until the end of 2018, including the one we are expecting today (we write this analysis before the june fomc decision). how is that possible with an economy that is allegedly booming, where wage pressures, albeit not severe, are gradually creeping higher? as such, my sanguine interpretation is that the reason the market is not spooked is that it thinks the fed is going to stay ""behind the curve."" as a word of caution, with a new fed chair coming next year, i would not count on the market being complacent; the new chair may well try to assert himself or herself, causing risk premia to rise. the pressure cooker may well try to release steam once again, until the fed chair then reacts to what may well be deteriorating financial conditions. this implies the fed won't be able to normalize its balance sheet, but is more likely to be heading towards qe again. indeed, my interpretation of fomc talk is that many members believe more qe is not a question of whether, but of when. if my analysis is correct, it suggests low rates for a very long time. and that, in turn, may of course mean that risk premia will ultimately be compressed yet again. so, maybe, it is different this time? let's look at equity investors. the brilliant minds (brilliant because they have made lots of money in recent years, please take this reference as being cynical) know that central banks will come to the rescue. so why not buy the dips? and stock prices always go up, don't they? you can't possibly be smarter than the masses (the index), and the index is going up, so buy, buy, buy. and we hear that this is different from the dot com bubble as, according to some metrics, stocks aren't terribly overvalued and could no up another 20%; let's make that 50%. i hear arguments for buying bitcoin, as it could go up tenfold or more, but it can only go down 100%, so the risk/reward must surely be worth it. indeed, i agree that it is extremely difficult to identify the top in a bubble. the question, in my view, is whether it's better to be early or to be late in taking chips off the table. it clearly depends on the risk profile of investors, but i would like to caution that those who don’t prepare early may well be late, terribly late. fear not, as the government might bail you out. except that they may not this time around, as banks aren't over-levered this time around. in our assessment, you ain't getting a bailout unless a systemically important institution is at risk. without providing specific investment advice, my view is that the best short-term strategy may be a good long term strategy. that may mean to rebalance a portfolio, take chips off the table, when times are good. the problem is, where on earth does one put those chips? historically, one would rebalance to fixed income, but in an era of extraordinarily low rates, investors are reaching for yield in the bucket that ought to be ""safe."" you don't need to be a doomsday forecaster to suggest that many investors may be over-exposed to risk assets as those higher yielding fixed income instruments may exhibit a high correlation to equities in a downturn. and when the masses all realize this - granted it may take considerable time as those 'buying the dips' won't be rooted out overnight - the carnage in the markets may well be severe. is the recent sell-off in the nasdaq the canary in the coal mine? we think it is, but the buy-the-dip troopers may well prove us wrong. for a day. or a week. or longer. but maybe not. so while the banks may not need a bailout, i'm not so sure about pension funds or individual investors. yet, ""needing a bailout"" and actually getting one are different stories. this analysis wouldn't be complete without looking at another elephant in the room: chinese banks. credit growth in china has been breathtaking; financial institutions, in my assessment, carry too much leverage. yet markets are well behaved. so if you are looking for a more traditional type of blow-up, china is a good candidate. chinese banks are systemically important and, as such, candidates for bailouts. china is a perfect example in my view where you have a market that appears calm, yet is subject to underlying pressures that we believe are unsustainable. that doesn’t mean it is obvious how any unwinding may unfold. but if past shockwaves attributed to china are any indication, it may not bode well for risk assets. all of this has led to a surge in index investing. the industry argues that the average investor cannot beat the index, especially after fees. well, it’s a mathematical certainty given that the average cannot beat the average when you deduct fees. that doesn’t mean investors should throw risk management out of the window; it doesn't mean buyers of tulips in 17th century netherlands were right; it doesn’t mean buyers of tech stocks in the late 90s were right. mind you, there are so many indices one can track these days that one can hardly call it passive, but active management is dead, a dying breed; or is it merely in a cyclical low? seemingly ever rising markets appear to have created a feedback loop. to me, this question is directly related to volatility: when risk premia are low, the dispersion of risk is low, making it difficult for active managers to shine. it doesn’t help that many active managers promote lower returns. why would you embrace lower returns than you can attain by chasing high flying stocks? the answer, of course, is risk management: those high-flying stocks might come crashing down. should risk premia rise once again, i.e. should volatility move higher, we believe there should be a larger number of active managers standing out. as such, my take is that active management will be embraced once again. that said, we may need substantial carnage in the markets for investors to realize their need to hire an active manager once again. and tomorrow’s active manager may well be different from yesterday’s given how the industry has changed.  just a few years ago, one would have been hard pressed to find an active manager to switch to different etfs depending on the market environment. similarly, a new breed of systematic trading strategies has risen that were a rarity a few years ago. in between, there is a range of new tools available to traditional active managers that may well become popular again. what it comes down to is constructing and managing a portfolio that suits the risk profile of the individual, the family office, the pension plan. it’s not about constructing a portfolio that suits fast money pundits or cocktail talk. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China Risk Management Twitter Exchange Traded Fund Volatility Trading Strategies Central Banks fixed Netherlands NASDAQ Quantitative Easing Systematic Trading Twitter Bitcoin,1

365,"""The Day Of The Dovish Hike?""",2017-06-14 12:02:00+00:00,"the paradox continues: on one hand stocks continue to anticipate a reflating economy, with s&p futures hitting a new all time high overnight; on the other hand, the weaker dollar and especially treasury yields are increasingly worried that today's rate hike, the 4th in the past decade, will be another policy error, leading to more curve flattening and eventually a deflationary outcome. and while there is little doubt yellen will hike today as goldman , and consensus, expect, the question is what the future pace of rate hikes will look like and whether the recent disappointing cpi prints will mean and ""one and done"" for the rest of the year from the fed. while there is some possibility of an unexpectedly hawkish statement from the fomc, especially if the fed is worried about an asset price bubble, it is far more likely that today's announcement will be yet another ""dovish hike"", which is what socgen's kit juckes previews in his latest overnight note. here is socgen with "" the day of the dovish hike?"" at 2.21%, us 10year yields are firmly in the low end of the 2017 range, while at 1.35%, 2s are very close to the highs. the treasury market is convinced the fed will hike today, but not convinced about the longer term. yesterday's nfib small business survey was just one of the data points to underline why the market is so perplexed. the response on ‘jobs hard to fill' is at 34%, the highest level since december 2000. but we can all see the lack of wage growth, which used, once upon a time, to correlate pretty well with this survey . hence the call from the likes of ex-minneapolis fed head naranya kocherlakota for the fed's inflation target to be raised; at the same time as 10year breakeven inflation rates on tiips fall to 1.78%, their lowest level since 8 november. the fomc’s response is likely to be a ‘dovish hike’ and that’s priced in, to a large degree. uncertain about how much slack there is in the economy or the labour market, focm members are inclined to want to ‘normalise’ rates while they have the chance, but they seem very pragmatic about the longer-term outlook. so more likely to raise rates now, without overlay hawkish commentary, and then lay the groundwork for another hike in the autumn if markets don’t take fright in the weeks ahead. that could leave yields in their range, the hunt for carry intact. obviously, since this is to some degree what the market expects, the converse is also true – a ‘hawkish hike’ would come as a big surprise and unsettle higher-yielding currencies. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",SocGen CPI NFIB,1

and possibly brexit talks. in currencies, there has been some moderate flow to report in a session looking ahead to the fomc meeting this evening, with traders looking past the 25bp rate hike largely priced in. we need to get a little colour on the rate path ahead, and just as importantly any fresh light on fed intentions on balance sheet reduction which may alter the rate profile to some degree. eur/usd and usd/jpy have been pretty balanced in the interim as a result, deviating less than 10-20 ticks from tight ranges seen over the week so far. more data for gbp traders to consider ahead of the boe meeting tomorrow, and given expectations are that the mpc will maintain their easy stance for a little longer given last week's events, this morning's softer than expected wage growth numbers will add fresh concern over the inflation profile. the numbers were a little higher than expected tuesday, but after today, the impact on household income is back in the frame. cable tested towards 1.2800 ahead of the release as the market looked to extend the relief aspect from the perception that a softer brexit is now more likely. theresa may seems insistent on taking a 'hard' stance, which seems a little futile under the circumstances. the spot rate has dipped back into the lower half of the 1.2700's since, but there seems to be limited conviction inside the broader range, with outliers at 1.3000 higher up and 1.2500-1.2400 lower down. in commodities , last night's api build reported went against the expectations in line with a series of recent draw downs, pulling wti back under usd46.00 again and with brent moving in tandem and still maintaining a usd2.00-2.50 premium to the former. we saw a 2.75m build vs the 4.6m draw previously, and but in relative terms the reaction has been modest, but with a view to looking for affirmation with the doe report later today. adding to support here, and to metals to a modest degree is the fresh weakness in the usd, and in turn, the prospect of a dovish hike this evening has lifted precious metals also as gold is back around usd1270 or so despite the positive sentiment reflected on wall street last night. silver remains below usd17.00 however. copper remains just under usd2.60 this morning but is well off the recent lows to suggest a period of consolidation ahead. aluminium also a touch lower today, but nickel, zinc and lead all sporting modest gains on the day. looking at the day ahead, the focus will be on the fomc decision due later in the day but before that we will get the may cpi number (+2.0% yoy expected; 2.2% previous) and retail sales data (+0.0% mom expected; +0.4% previous). according to db, the headline retail sales series should slow due to another disappointing month for unit motor vehicle sales; however, sales excluding automobiles should fare a bit better. with respect to the cpi, db expects energy prices will drag on the headline, likely resulting in a flat month-over-month reading. however he notes that the core cpi series  will receive significant attention given that the last couple of prints have been surprisingly soft – particularly highlighting that the fomc specifically mentioned the march core cpi decline in its may meeting statement. thereafter all focus should shift to the fomc meeting and press conference. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap overnight we've had the monthly key activity indicators for china released and they were broadly stable. fixed asset investment (fai) grew by 8.6% yoy ytd, slightly lower than 8.9% in april. retail sales and industrial production both grew at the same pace as in april (10.7% and 6.5% respectively). chinese stocks slipped, led by financial and developer shares, amid investor concern that regulators will place further curbs on insurers’ equity investments. the shanghai composite fell 0.6% as property and insurance sectors fell on fears of continued curbs for the former and tighter regulation for the sector. the hang seng is -0.3% with the nikkei 0.1%. asia is mostly waiting for the fed. turning now to markets yesterday, global equities were broadly higher recovering some of monday’s losses. over in the us the s&p 500 and the nasdaq both saw gains of +0.45% and +0.7% respectively with the s&p 500 and dow back at record highs. the tech stocks are recovering a little after a difficult 48 hours. european equities saw a similar bounce with the stoxx 600 up by +0.6% while the dax and ftse mib were up by +0.6% and +0.9% on the day. the odd one out in europe was the ftse 100 which dropped by -0.2% on the day, likely as sterling (+0.7%) gained for the first time since last week’s elections on slightly more stable politics and firmer data. staying in the uk, gilts sold off yesterday across all maturities (2y: +5bps; 10y: +7bps) as uk inflation overshot in may. data out yesterday saw consumer prices outpace expectations by growing at a four-year high of +2.9% yoy (vs. 2.7% expected; 2.7% previous). retail prices were also up 3.7% yoy (vs. 3.5% expected; 3.5% previous) although wholesale price inflation remained more in line with expectations as ppi rose by +3.6% yoy (+3.6% previous). elsewhere in government bond markets, the us yield curve was broadly unchanged on the day (with only marginal flattening) ahead of the fomc tomorrow whereas german bunds saw yields rise across all maturities (2y: +3bps; 10y: +2bps). french oats saw yields tick up from the 2y point (+2bps) all the way to the 10y (+1bp) but yields at the very long end fell (30y -2bps). italian btps saw yields fall across all maturities (2y -2bps; 10y -4bps) as the recent more positive political sentiment continues in the country. credit markets saw spreads broadly continue to tighten yesterday. in europe itraxx main and crossover saw spread tighten by -1bp and -3bps respectively, while in the us we saw cdx ig and hy tighten by -1bp and -3bps on the day. turning to fx markets, we saw the us dollar and the euro both hold fairly steady on the day. in the commodities space, we saw oil give up decent gains after a late day announcement of a surprise build up of us crude inventories. metals on the other hand were broadly flat to lower. away from the inflation data out of the uk, we had a bit more data out of europe to get through. we got the june zew survey in germany which was a bit of a mixed bag – the current situation component clocked in above expectations at 88.0 (vs. 85.0 expected; 83.9 previous) while the expectations component deteriorated to 18.6 (vs. 21.7 expected; 20.6 previous). over in the us we got the may nfib small business optimism reading which held steady as expected at 104.5, while the may us ppi report saw wholesale prices unchanged on the month (+0.5% previous), although ex food and energy prices rose by more than expected (+0.3% mom vs. +0.1% expected). looking at the day ahead now, in europe we are due to get the final may cpi numbers for germany (with no revisions expected). we also get uk labour market data where the focus should be on the three month unemployment rate as of april (expected to hold steady at 4.6%) as well as weekly earnings numbers for april and jobless claims data for may. following that we will also get the eurozone industrial production readings for april which is expected to head back into positive territory (+0.5% mom vs. -0.1% previous). over in the us the focus will be on the fomc decision due later in the day but before that we will get the may cpi number (+2.0% yoy expected; 2.2% previous) and retail sales data (+0.0% mom expected; +0.4% previous). our chief us economist joseph lavorgna notes that the headline retail sales series should slow due to another disappointing month for unit motor vehicle sales;

370,"Goldman: The Fed Will Hike But Here Are ""The Two Most Interesting Questions""",2017-06-14 09:23:00+00:00,"today the fomc will hike rates by another 25 bps - an event which the fed funds market prices in with near virtual certainty, while goldman calls the rate increase ""extremely likely"" - and only a ""tail"" event like an extremely weak cpi report hours ahead of the fed announcement, has any chance of preventing  this outcome. so with the next rate hike virtually inevitable, questions are focused on not only the fed's exit strategy for balance sheet normalization and what the ""dots"" or funds rate path will look like, but how the fed squares rising rates with the recent string of inflation misses. as goldman's jan hatzius writes, data since the march meeting has sharpened the dilemma that both sides of the mandate are sending increasingly different signals about the urgency of further tightening. ""the unemployment rate has fallen 0.4pp since the march meeting and our current activity indicator and real gdp estimates signal that above-trend output growth will produce further labor market improvement. but the year-over-year core pce inflation is now 0.2pp lower than at the march meeting."" while conceding that a hike is guaranteed, goldman notes that two issues should make this meeting particularly interesting. as a result of the weaker than expected inflationary prints, goldman believes the recent data do not call for a major change in the fed’s policy outlook. while hatzius expects the fomc to lower its estimate of the structural unemployment rate by a tenth next week, even with that assumption, the new data have broadly offsetting implications for the policy outlook in standard taylor rules. highlighting recent fed communications, goldman believes the fed will follow ""a balanced approach in dealing with the dilemma."" it also means that the statement will likely characterize economic activity as ""picking up but recognize that inflation slowed since earlier this year."" on the other side, goldman sees a signal of heightened inflation concern as the main dovish risk and an upgrade of the balance of risks as the main hawkish risk . previewing the fed's summary of economic projections (sep), expect a modest downgrade to gdp growth for this year, coupled with declines in the unemployment rate to 4.3% this year and 4.2% next year. at the same time, projections for core pce inflation are likely to fall to 1.8% this year and probably 1.9% in 2018. reflecting the offsetting data news, expect the “dot plot” to show relatively stable funds rate projections. on to yellen's press conference, which should provide some clarity on whether the next tightening step after june will be balance sheet normalization or a third funds rate hike. goldman, as well as much of the street, expects balance sheet adjustment to start in september and the fed hiking cycle to resume in december. with respect to the balance sheet, the fed will initially cap the amounts of securities that can run off in any given month of $10bn for ust and $5 billion for mbs, that rise over four quarters to caps of $40 billion and $20 billion, respectively. * * * some more details. here is goldman on the current economic situation, and how it will be (mis)read by the fed. another rate increase from the fomc next week is now extremely likely. only an extremely weak cpi report on wednesday morning or another tail event would prevent the committee from hiking. the committee probably also still expects a total of three hikes and the start of balance sheet adjustment in 2017. but two issues should make this meeting particularly interesting. we believe both labor market and growth data in hand make a strong case for a rate increase next week and to remain upbeat about the outlook. both our current activity indicator —down from 4.0% in february to 3.0% in may— and real gdp estimates—up from 1.2% in q1 to our 2.3% q2 tracking estimate—signal above-trend output growth (exhibit 1, left panel). the medium-term growth outlook is also decent despite the lower odds of significant fiscal easing. the more important reason why growth should stay firm is the easing in financial conditions. our fci is at the easiest level since early 2015 and has  eased by 50bp since the march fomc meeting. as the right panel of exhibit 1 shows, the expected effect on gdp growth from changes in financial conditions for 2018h1 is now more than 0.3pp higher than at the march meeting. spare capacity continues to diminish, and the unemployment rate has fallen 0.4pp since the march meeting to a 16-year low of 4.3% (exhibit 2, left panel). while nonfarm payroll growth has recently softened a bit, the average monthly gain of 162k year-to-date is still double our 85k estimate of the “breakeven” rate needed to keep the unemployment rate unchanged. while slack measures have declined more than expected, weak inflation data in april and especially march pushed the year-over-year pace of core pce inflation 0.2pp lower than at the march meeting (exhibit 2, right panel). both a taylor rule framework and recent fed communications suggest that the new data have broadly offsetting implications for the policy outlook. exhibit 3 translates the labor market and inflation surprises into changes in the appropriate funds rate via a standard taylor rule framework. the original taylor rule implies that a 0.2pp decline in inflation lowers the appropriate funds rate by 30bp while a 0.4pp reduction in the unemployment rate raises the appropriate funds rate by 40bp. in a modified “taylor 1999” rule, the impact of employment is doubled  relative to the original version. this means that the impact of a 0.4pp reduction in unemployment rises from 40bp to 80bp. the left panel of exhibit 3 thus suggests a 10-50bps higher appropriate funds rate. but the decline in the unemployment rate may overstate the surprise if some decline was expected. similarly, the decline in inflation can understate the surprise if some firming was expected. the middle panel of exhibit 3 therefore compares actual unemployment and inflation moves to our expectations as of the march meeting and has less hawkish implications than the left panel. finally, a lower estimate of the structural unemployment rate also reduces the decline in the unemployment rate gap. on net, we estimate the new data—combined with a 0.1pp downgrade of the structural rate—would have an exactly neutral effect in the taylor 1999 rule that chair yellen has discussed repeatedly. what has the fed communicated in recent week. recent fed communication suggests that the committee will also consider surprises on both sides of the mandate as roughly offsetting. as exhibit 4 shows, several fed officials have emphasized that there is now little labor market slack left. the inflation language in the may minutes was quite balanced as ”most participants viewed the recent softer inflation data as primarily reflecting transitory factors, but a few expressed concern that progress toward the committee’s objective may have slowed.” since the may meeting, inflation for april has been weak for core cpi (0.9% annualized) but roughly in line for core pce (1.8% annualized). the april inflation reports and recent comments by some fed officials including chicago fed president evans suggest that additional signs of heightened inflation vigilance are a dovish risk relative to our expectations. governor powell said that “there are good reasons to expect that inflation will resume its gradual rise but it is important to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our symmetric 2 percent objective” while philadelphia fed president harker said that “we’re still on track for inflation” and that he is “looking at the trend.” in light of these developments we expect to the committee to make three key changes to its post-meeting statement next week. first, we expect the committee to replace “consumer prices declined in march” by “inflation slowed since earlier this year” reflecting the core cpi miss in april. second, we expect the statement to upgrade the growth assessment with verbiage along the lines of economic activity “appears  to have picked up” and to note that household spending “appears to be accelerating”. third, we expect the committee to tacitly signal balance sheet run-off later this year by adding the qualifier “for the time being” to the description of its existing reinvestment policy. a signal of heightened inflation concerns is the key dovish risk. the committee may, for instance, drop the “somewhat” from “inflation continued to run somewhat below 2 percent ”. in terms of hawkish risks, an upgrade of the balance of risks is possible through the removal of “roughly”, reflecting improved domestic and international growth. we also expect minneapolis fed president neel kaskhkari to dissent as he recently described the move of inflation in “the wrong direction” as “concerning”. what about the revised summary of economic projections the june fomc meeting will include the quarterly update to the sep. we expect significant changes to the unemployment and inflation projections but relatively stable funds rate forecasts, reflecting offsetting job market and inflation news. 1. slightly lower gdp growth: assuming our q2 gdp tracking 1. estimate of 2.3%, gdp growth will average 1.7% annualized over the first half of 2017, so it would take a 2.4% growth rate in h2 to meet the policymakers march sep estimate of 2.1%. we expect the 2017 median to fall to 2.0%, with risk tilted to the upside. we forecast that the median estimates for gdp growth in 2018-2019 and in the longer-run will remain unchanged. 2. lower unemployment rate. the unemployment rate fell 0.4pp since the march meeting when the median unemployment rate projection was 4.5% for the forecasting horizon. we expect the median to fall to 4.3% in 2017, 4.2% in 2018 (with risks of 4.3%) and 4.3% in 2019. the estimate of the structural unemployment rate is quite likely to fall further from 4.7% to 4.6% in response to large declines in the actual rate and recent news on prices and wages. the decline in nairu would limit somewhat the projected employment overshoot but is a close call. 3. lower core pce inflation. we expect the 2017 median core pce projection to fall to 1.8% and perhaps 1.7%. to reach 1.8% by year-end, monthly core pce inflation would need to accelerate to an annualized rate of at least 1.9%. we believe the 2018 forecast also drops a tenth to 1.9% as some members now likely feel a bit less confident about the inflation outlook. 4. relatively stable median dots. we expect most participants, especially those in the center of the committee, to stick to their march dots reflecting offsetting inflation and unemployment moves. we also believe that the committee probably still expects a total of three hikes in 2017. the retirement of tarullo lowers the numbers of participants to 16 from 17 in march and is likely to move up the median 2018 dot from to 3 to 3-1/2 hikes next year. as the fomc is extremely likely to hike for the second time this year next week, we expect that the 2017 one-hikers will shift to projecting 2 hikes in total for this year. we also assume that the new atlanta fed president bostic votes like his predecessor lockhart and that the new richmond fed president mullinix lowers the richmond fed dots a bit. finally, how will the fed ""renornalize"" its balance sheet. we expect to get some more clarity next week on balance sheet runoff at the press conference and possibly also with an augmented policy normalization principles and plan. we continue to look for normalization to be announced in september. here we update our projections for balance sheet runoff: 1. start date: we expect a detailed announcement in september  but would not be surprised if it came in december as guidance has been mixed. the may minutes suggest a start in september as an announcement at the december meeting would leave little time to “begin reducing the federal reserve’s securities this year”. but guidance on the start of runoff by governor brainard after the funds rate gets midway to its long-run value of 3.0% and by new york fed president dudley “sometime later this year or next year” supports december. we think that announcing the start of balance sheet adjustment in september and keeping open the option of foregoing the third 2017 hike is the more prudent course of action given the mixed recent data and the potential for fiscal turmoil in washington in q3 related to the need for a debt ceiling hike and an extension of spending authority. we think the detailed announcement in september will be followed by the actual start of runoff of assets in october. 2. process for phasing out reinvestment : the may minutes signaled that the committee will preannounce a schedule of gradually increasing caps to limit the amounts of securities that can run off in any given month. our assumption is that that the initial caps are $10 billion a month for ust and $5 billion a month for mbs. the caps would rise each quarter by $10 billion and $5 billion to $40 billion and $20 billion respectively. exhibit 7 shows that caps allow for a gradual runoff and deal with the variability associated with mbs prepayment and the irregular monthly schedule of maturing assets. the caps will remain in place after the phase-in but then only bind in roughly a third of the months for treasuries until mid-2020 when the balance sheet reaches its projected terminal size. 3. terminal size: we expect the fed to maintain a balance sheet that 3. is relatively large by historical standards given several advantages of a large balance sheet related to monetary policy implementation and regulatory needs. our calculations suggest that a monetary policy implementation through a floor system implies a terminal size of roughly 15.5% of gdp. while support from the new york fed for the large balance scenario makes this outcome quite likely, there is no urgency yet in deciding on the size and on the composition of the terminal balance sheet. goldman's conclusion: a third consecutive quarterly rate increase next week is now extremely likely, in our view . only an extremely weak cpi report on wednesday morning or another tail event would prevent the committee from hiking. the data news since march has sharpened the dual mandate dilemma policymakers are facing. our own view is that the inflation and unemployment surprises have been roughly offsetting but that the range of outcomes has widened somewhat. while the inflation outlook is uncertain, the dilemma will most likely resolve itself as inflation gradually accelerates. we therefore expect policymakers to remain focused on tightening mostly with the funds rate but also soon with the balance sheet tool. and while we agree with goldman in theory , one thing the bank has omitted in principle is that according to the fed's own commercial loan data, the us economy may be just 4-6 weeks away from posting its first negative c&i loan print since the financial crisis: a virtually failsafe indication of an imminent (or concurrent) recession. which means that, as we explained yesterday , the fed is about to hike in not only a disinflationary phase of the economic cycle (which is largely a function of the slowdown in the chinese commoity bubble, and the collapse in the chinese credit impulse), but also into what may be an outright recession in the us. if so, look for the yield curve to do what it has always done in the past after the fed hikes rates: flatten, then flatten some more, than go horizontal, and eventually invert. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads

380,RBC: Tomorrow's CPI Print Is More Important To The Market Than The Fed,2017-06-14 02:38:00+00:00,"with a 95% implied probability of a rate hike tomorrow, there is little doubt that janet yellen will raise rates, although as goldman previewed two days , there are at least two open issues should make tomorrow's meeting somewhat interesting: first, will fed officials alter their policy views in response to the increasingly different signals that both sides of the mandate are sending about the urgency of further tightening... and ... second, will the press conference provide some clarity on what the next tightening step following the june hike will be ? but by and far, tomorrow's fomc announcement will be a non-event, unless - as some have suggested - yellen tries to collapse the extra easy monetary conditions which as db and gs calculated recently, are the loosest they have been since 2014 , courtesy of the ongoing qe at the ecb and boj. so instead of the much anticipated fomc, keep a closer eye on tomorrow's inflation report. according to rbc's charlie mcelliggott, the wednesday cpi print will have a more meaningful impact on the near term direction of the market than yellen's priced in decision. charlie explains: then again maybe not even the cpi will be a surprise: going into tomorrow's print, virtually all inflation proxies have already thrown in the towel. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Janet Yellen CPI,1

401,"A Reminder Of The ""Risk Free"" Trade Ahead Of Tomorrow's Fed Announcement",2017-06-13 20:32:00+00:00,"in short, buy stocks. remember that 2011 ny fed study which found that since 1994, a stunning 80% of all equity returns on u.s. stocks were generated over the twenty-four hours preceding scheduled federal open market committee announcements, a phenomenon called the pre-fomc announcement “drift .” well, we are now in that 24 hour period - which starts roughly now and accelerates into 2pm on wednesday, when the fed is widely expected to hike by another 25 bps - and over the weekend goldman decided to take another look at this performance ""drift"", or as goldman calls it, ""the fomc alpha"" and similarly finds that average returns are higher on fomc announcement days. so is tomorrow (and today) a buy-and-forget ""guaranteed profit"" day for daytraders just because ""new information"" is released from the (overly dovish) fed? the answer appears to be yes. as goldman writes, market participants and policymakers are well aware that asset prices respond to new information released on fomc announcement days. but, what is perhaps less well known is that a sizable portion of average yearly asset returns is generated on these days. for example, a strategy that goes short the usd versus a basket of all other g10 currencies has provided an average daily annualized return of about 80bp on fomc announcement dates, compared with an average daily annualized return of about 30bp on any other day of the year. to make this point, the bank demonstrates that stocks and foreign currencies outperform on fomc announcement days. ""we show that the ‘fomc alpha’ has been sizable for long positions in major dm equity markets, as well as for strategies that short the usd versus all g10 currencies but the yen, and versus some major ems (try, zar and mxn in particular). by contrast, investments in major sovereign bonds do not tend to deliver a larger or smaller return on an fomc day relative to the return earned on any other day of the year. we also find that these patterns are more sizable in the post-global financial crisis (gfc) period."" still, despite the demonstrable ""drift"" effect, not even goldman knows precisely what to attribute it to: "" what explains the ‘fomc alpha’? we need to know this in order to assess whether these observed patterns are likely to persist and, if so, for how long. among the items listed are compensation for risk, risk appetite, a central bank that surprised more on the dovish than on the hawkish side on fomc announcement days, and investors’ perception of a ‘dovish fed’ are non-mutually exclusive explanations for the excess asset returns earned on fomc days. a few or all of these factors play a role in explaining the excess return on some assets on fomc announcement days. what does it mean for the future ""the patterns in asset returns observed on fomc days in the past few years, on average, are unlikely to disappear any time soon "" which likely suggests that buying now and all that way until 2:00pm tomorrow is a ""risk-free"" trade, unless of course everyone jumps on board, in which case it just may not work. the findings are relatively straightforward: as the first two charts show, while equity markets tend to outperform across the board on fomc days, the usd is to be shorted. as goldman writes discussing the above charts, which show sizable excess returns on fomc announcement days, "" equities and foreign currencies have tended to generate positive excess returns on fomc days (exhibits 3-4)."" in particular, on fomc days, the s&p 500 has historically moved up by an average of 30bp and other g10 equity markets indices have also delivered positive returns. these returns are statistically different from average returns on any other day of the year. turning to currencies, the usd has tended to depreciate versus all other g10 currencies, except for jpy. in em fx space, we concentrate on the most liquid currencies (brl, mxn, try, rub and zar, see global markets daily: em fx sensitivities ahead of dm central bank meetings, sep. 9, 2016 for more detail) and find that they have all outperformed the usd on days when the fomc meets (exhibit 5). in general, across g10 and em fx, currencies with a wider interest rate differential versus the usd have provided higher returns (exhibit 6). this suggests that a portfolio that goes long high-yielding currencies and short the usd could potentially deliver the best relative performance on an fomc day."" the next set of charts show the recurring beating which the dollar tends to suffer on fomc days: it goes without saying, that excess returns on stocks and foreign currencies tend to be larger (smaller) on a fomc day when the fed delivers a dovish (hawkish) surprise on the day. and while the drift has been demonstrated to exist since at least 1994, the ""fomc alpha"" has been larger post crisis . goldman explains: given the sizable average excess returns on some investments on fomc announcement days, it is important to understand whether the patterns we have identified so far are robust, or are driven by only a few fomc meetings. first, we split the sample into two sub-periods: pre- and post-2008. we note that the patterns we have shown above are more pronounced since 2008 than before (exhibit 7 and 8). second, we check to see whether the excess returns on long equity and short usd positions on fomc announcement days hold even in a more recent sample, starting in 2014. they do. however, given the limited number of fomc meetings included in this shorter sample, the difference in returns on fomc and non-fomc announcement days is not often statistically significant. finally, we compute rolling average excess returns over a one-year period (and, hence, only eight fomc meetings) to check that no particular period drives the difference we find between returns on fomc and non-fomc dates. exhibits 9 and 10 show the rolling coefficients for the s&p 500 and the trade-weighted usd index we compute versus all other g10 currencies. even though the period 2008-2009 drives a lot of the action, the average change in fx and equity prices on fomc announcement days is larger than that for other days across the entire sample. one striking observation from this exercise is also how much of an outlier the 2013-2014 period was . starting with the june 2013 press conference in which then-chairman bernanke laid out a ‘taper timeline’, the fomc delivered an uncharacteristic series of hawkish surprises. that included in march 2014 an upward revision to the ‘dots’ and remarks from chair yellen that the first hike could come just six months after the end of qe, as well as a number of smaller hawkish surprises. our takeaway from this analysis is that this period was quite unusual for the fed, and probably partly the result of a series of communication missteps rather than a genuine effort to ‘be hawkish ’. through this lens, it is understandable why the fed is now trying so hard to communicate more clearly around the start of balance sheet normalization. it also demonstrates that, even now during this period of policy tightening, market participants who expect the fomc to deliver hawkish surprises to tighten financial conditions may be disappointed, at least on announcement days, as that is not typical. but the best visualization of the ""fomc alpha"" is laid out as follows: to create the underlying data, goldman focused on meetings with a press conference starting from 2013, particularly when the fed releases the summary of economic projections and the chair holds a press conference. the chart below show the average change in the eur/usd and the s&p 500 cumulated minute-by-minute, starting at 8.30 am ny in the morning of the fomc day until the ny closing. the s&p 500 continues to move higher during the press conference, a testament that on average press conferences continue to deliver ‘dovish’ news. movements in the eur/usd have been less clear-cut, on average, between 2 pm and the end of the press conference, but the evidence after the press conference that the usd continues to depreciate on average also points in the same direction . the obvious conclusion: a sizable portion of excess returns on riskier assets is generated, on average, on fomc announcement days rather than on other days of the year . in addition to the academic literature, which has identified this pattern, goldman has likewise shown that it still holds in very recent periods. that said, the bank makes it clear its analysis is not about one single fomc meeting, when the fed was particularly hawkish or dovish, nor it is about ‘getting it right’ on any single meeting but instead to highlight the oddly recurring ""investment opportunities that are more likely than not to be profitable over a series of fomc meetings during one or a number of years."" so will buying the s&p now and all the way until 2pm tomorrow be another profitable trade, or - now that everyone has been reminded of this ""risk free"" trade - will this self-referential perspective spoil the predestined prfotable outcome? the answer will be revealed tomorrow shortly after 2pm. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com

""if the fed is tightening policy and embarking on a gradual normalization path, whether it is the short-term policy rates or the balance sheet, it wants the market to believe it and to adjust to it,"" said frederik ducrozet, an economist at pictet wealth management. ""it is not just about complacency and the creation of financial bubbles...but also about its own credibility."" the bank of japan and the bank of england also meet this week, although no major policy changes are expected. according to a retuers poll, a small majority of traders in china's financial markets think its central bank will likely raise short-term interest rates again this week if the u.s. federal reserve hikes its key policy rate. but the reaction to this in bond markets has been concerning. china's two-year yields have in the last few sessions risen above its 10-year yields- a trend that has only happened in a few instances over the past decade and suggests investors have worries over the long-term health of the world's second biggest economy. this morning, almost every industry group in the stoxx europe 100 index traded in the green, with the abovementioned tech bounce meanings technology shares are poised for the largest gain in more than a month. the stoxx europe 600 index climbed 0.6 percent as of 11:17 a.m. in london, after dropping 1 percent on monday. tech shares rose 1.3 percent. futures on the s&p 500 index rose 0.2 percent. the nasdaq 100 fell 0.6 percent on monday, adding to its 2.4 percent rout on friday. apple fell 2.4 percent while microsoft corp. slid 0.8 percent. in asia, msci's broadest index of asia-pacific shares outside japan rose 0.5 percent, recouping about half of the previous session's losses. the msci asia pacific information technology index steadied, after sliding 1.4 percent on monday. australian equities rallied 1.7 percent, the most since november, as bank stocks jumped after investors returned from a holiday. south korea’s kospi added 0.7 percent, with samsung electronics co. little changed after leading declines in asia during monday’s rout. hong kong’s hang seng rose 0.6 percent as tencent holdings ltd., which tumbled 2.5 percent in the previous session, rebounded 0.7 percent. some analysts had predicted asian tech shares would not see as intense a sell-off as their u.s. peers as their valuations were less stretched. ""comparatively, valuations for the it sector in the asia pacific region are less expensive compared to the u.s., which may be why we're not seeing the situation further aggravate for a second session,"" said jingyi pan, market strategist at ig in singapore. sterling headed for the first increase since the election that’s left u.k. prime minister may battling to shore up her position. she’ll meet northern ireland’s democratic unionists today, seeking the votes she needs to be able to pass any legislation. the pound strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.2711 after sliding 0.7 percent on monday. the canadian dollar hit a two-month high after a policymaker said the central bank would assess if it needs to keep rates at near-record lows as the economy grows. ""it feels like a long time since markets have been treated to unscheduled hints of tightening, and this was quite apparent when you saw the positive reaction of cad crosses overnight,"" matt simpson, senior market analyst at thinkmarkets in melbourne, wrote in a note. elsewhere, the euro fluctuated before gaining less than 0.1 percent to $1.1210. the bloomberg dollar spot index fell by 0.1 percent.  the yen fell 0.2 percent to 110.12 per dollar, after monday’s 0.3 percent gain. the yield on 10-year treasuries was little changed; before today it climbed for four straight sessions. german benchmark yields rose two basis points, french equivalents increased three basis points and u.k. yields added five basis points. wti, brent were supported by positive risk sentiment globally. brent trades near $48.50/bbl, wti above $46 with industry-funded api data on u.s. stockpiles due later. “the market’s just waiting for the api data,” says nitesh shah, commodities strategist at etf securities. “there’s some expectations for a bit of a correction from last week’s disappointment.” api data due 4:30pm et, crude inventories forecast to decline 2.25m bbl in more definitive eia data wednesday. weaker dollar, positive equities supported prices earlier tuesday. tomorrow the fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate for the second time this year on wednesday. since that’s widely expected, the more market-sensitive elements of the meeting will relate to signals on future policy -- either the path for rates or plans to cut the $4.5 trillion balance sheet. central banks in japan, switzerland and britain are also scheduled to weigh in with policy decisions this week. bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot top overnight news asian stocks shrugged off the negative lead from us where the tech sector once again underperformed and posted its worst 2-day period ytd. nonetheless, the tone in asia improved throughout the session with asx 200 (+1.2%) underpinned by financials after gains in the big 4 banks, while nikkei 225 (unch.) recovered from early losses alongside a rebound in usd/jpy. elsewhere, shanghai comp. (+0.4%) was indecisive with early weakness observed alongside speculation the pboc may raise rates in response to a us fed hike and after another lacklustre liquidity operation, although chinese stocks then recovered to conform to the overall improvement of risk sentiment in the region. 10yr jgbs were lower amid an improvement in risk sentiment throughout the session, while today's 20yr auction later also failed to spur demand with the results mixed in which the accepted prices declined from prior. pboc injected cny 10bin in 7-day reverse repos and cny 40bin in 28-day reverse repos. top asian news european bourses have seen mixed gains with the eurostoxx 50 roughly halfway to recouping yesterday's losses led by the recovering the tech sector. notable movers of the morning is capita with shares surging as much as 15% as the company pins hopes on improving profitability and secure more contract wins in the second half of the year. in fixed income markets, core european bond yields have seen a recovery this morning with the german 10yr up 1.2bps, while outperformance has been observed in peripheral markets led by spain and italy. top european news in commodities, it has been another mixed session where on the upside we see some modest gains in oil price this morning, which as yet looks to be corrective, though value levels in wti seem to have drawn in buyers ahead of usd45.00. brent is keeping its usd2.00-2.50 differential and trades in the mid usd48.00's, but where `value' currently stands is arbitrary to a larger degree, given the weakness has been down to the rise in us shale production which translates into greater self-sufficiency. elsewhere, metals prices are lower, but all inside familiar territory to point to sideways price action more than anything else. copper has dipped back towards usd2.60 and just under, but the moves above this level were somewhat of a surprise in any case. on the day, zinc is the underperformer at down over 1.0%. gold is still better supported than silver as the latter has now relinquished the usd17 handle. in currencies, the key usd rates have been in consolidation mode this morning, with usd/jpy edging back above 110.00 but with little conviction. the fomc meeting ahead is now in focus, and while traders are not phased over the 25bp hike largely priced in, there is a sense that the market may have gotten a little overly dovish on the accompanying statement and rhetoric, but on the balance on the data, this has been justified to some degree. this morning's data focus was on uk inflation, but despite the welcome break from politics, inflation was only slightly higher than expected (worth noting during a time of gbp appreciation), but not by enough to trouble the boe who are set to keep policy measures as they are, and more so given fresh political uncertainty. at the start of europe, wesaw cable retesting the 1.2610-40 base, and having survived tests in ny, asia and early london, higher levels now look set to be tested at 1.2740-50 initially. eur/gbp is also giving way a little, with sellers benefitting from the more relaxed tone in eur/usd. the cad continues to grind higher in the aftermath of the comments from the boc's wilkins, who says it is time to assess the current stimulus levels. we cannot help but point out that the q1 gdp data was healthy, as was friday's jobs report, but clearly the market required some reassurances from official quarters, so usd/cad is now probing the next support zone into 1.3250-1.3150. looking at today's calendar, we get the may nfib small business optimism number which printed at 105.2, unchanged from last month, and missing expectations 105.2, while the may ppi report is due later in the afternoon (2.3% yoy vs. 2.5% previous). us event calendar * * * db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap global equities were on the soft side yesterday. over in the us the s&p 500 saw losses of -0.1% while the nasdaq extended friday’s declines by falling another -0.5%. however both markets were off the lows of the session. the very recent tech sell-off was the talk of the town yesterday as opinion was divided as to whether this was money leaving equities or simply a rotation back into more defensive stocks. markets in asia have stabilised overnight with the nikkei -0.05% but with the hang seng +0.5% and the shanghai comp +0.3%. in europe the stoxx fell by -1.0%, with the dax and ftse also dropping by -1.0% and -0.2% respectively. credit markets however seemed immune to these risk-off moves. in europe itraxx main and crossover tightened by -1bp and -2bps respectively. in the us cdx ig was flat on the day while hy tightened by -2bp. turning to the government bond market, german and us 10y yields both fell by -1bp, while their respective 2y points were unchanged on the day – hence a small flattening. elsewhere in europe gilts (2y: -1bp; 10y: -4bps) and french oats (2y: -3bp; 10y: -5bp) saw yields drop across maturities, while italian btps saw all yields beyond the 2y point drop (10y: -7bp). the strong performance of president macron's party in the first round of the french legislative elections helping as did the relatively weak performance of the 5sm in regional elections in italy over the weekend. turning to fx markets now and sterling extended friday’s losses by dropping another -0.7% yesterday (flat overnight though). on the whole the election shock last week has compounded political uncertainty in the uk and has thrown up a number of new questions clouding the outlook for the currency. our fx strategists published a note yesterday arguing that developments over the weekend following the election have provided sufficient evidence for a muddlethrough brexit strategy (as previously outlined as their baseline). they highlight that it is premature for the market to start pricing the soft brexit narrative given that no political party or grouping has an incentive to change the status quo, which would likely lead to a period of acute political paralysis in coming months. hence the risk of a disruptive brexit is rising – as timelines are fixed, the more decisions are delayed, the greater the risk that there is no time left to negotiate something non-disruptive. all of the above increase downside risks to an already gloomy outlook for the uk economy, leaving the boe on hold as the fed and ecb tighten and push interest rate differentials further against the pound. taking these factors into consideration, the outlook for sterling is particularly negative and the team reiterates their bearish view. away from sterling, the us dollar and the euro were both broadly flat on the day. over in the commodity space, oil saw gains of +0.4% on the day while metals were broadly higher. gold however failed to recoup any of its past week’s losses and remained essentially unchanged. going back to all things brexit/uk related, the ft reported over the weekend that today marks the day that brussels opines on how it will police the $850bn a day otc euro-denominated derivatives market that currently clears in london. this may be an early marker for how financial markets, banks and brexit will coincide so worth watching. also worth noting is that pm theresa may met her influential 1922 backbench committee last night and it's been reported that she took the blame for the party's disappointing performance last week. on a related theme, one of the more amusing stories yesterday was news (reuters/ bbc) that the uk’s queen’s speech (where the government set out the next year's legislative agenda) scheduled for next monday may be delayed a few days as the conservative party’s ‘understanding’ with the dup party has not been finalised yet. although it’s expected to be agreed very soon, the queen’s speech apparently has to be written on goat's skin parchment paper, which takes a few days to dry. the latest ecb cspp numbers were out yesterday. they bought €1.421bn last week which is €355mn/day (assuming 4 days given the european holiday last monday). the average daily run rate since cspp started is €367mn. in relative terms, the cspp/pspp ratio dropped to 11.9% last week (pspp purchases were €11.94bn) which is still mildly above the 11.6% average ratio before qe was trimmed. since the taper it's been 13.4% on average indicating less tapering of corporates. there's still quite a lot of noise week to week to be a 100% confidence that corporates have been tapered less but the evidence still points in that direction. yesterday was a very quiet day in terms of data. the only data point of note out of europe was the bank of france business sentiment for may which was in line with consensus (105 vs. 104 previous). there was no real data to note out of the us. today is a bit busier in terms of data. we kick off in the uk where we are due to receive the may inflation numbers (cpi +0.2% mom expected; rpi +0.3% mom expected; ppi +0.1% mom expected). elsewhere in europe we will also get the zew survey in germany where survey numbers are expected to tick up marginally (current situation: 85.0 expected vs. 83.9 previous; expectations: 21.7 expected vs. 20.6 previous). over in the us we get the may nfib small business optimism number which is expected to hold steady (104.5 expected) while the may ppi report is due later in the afternoon (2.3% yoy vs. 2.5% previous). tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Apple China Morgan Stanley Gilts Donald Trump Germany Japan OTC Crude Oil Reuters Bank of England European Central Bank Federal Reserve Testimony Nasdaq 100 Bank of Japan Switzerland Equity Markets Yen Central Banks Bond fixed Canadian Dollar CPI Crude NASDAQ Copper Price Action European Union recovery FBI BOE Greece NFIB Jim Reid Italy Core CPI Nikkei France,1

502,"""Tech Wreck"" Goes Global Dragging Worldwide Markets Lower; Cable, USDJPY Slide",2017-06-12 11:50:00+00:00,"first the bad news : following friday's ""tech wreck"" european equity markets have opened lower, with the stoxx 600 sliding 0.9% and back under the 50dma for the first time since december, dragged by selloff in tech shares, mirroring asian markets as friday’s ""faamg"" volatility in u.s. markets spreads globally, battering shares from south korea to the netherlands. european banks lag as the spanish regulator stepped in to prevent another bank collapse, this time of liberbank which we profiled yesterday , by banning short-selling in the regional commercial bank to mitigate popular-related contagion. samsung electronics, asml holding and tencent holdings led declines in europe and asia, dragging down benchmark indexes according to bloomberg . u.s. stock futures, which ignored friday's tech move, also fell as markets continue to digest the nasdaq 100’s plunge on friday. europe's tech index fell as much as 2.8% to put it on track for its biggest one-day loss since october. the index had reached a 15-year high earlier this month and has soared around 40 percent over the last year as discussed over the weekend, the sudden slide in tech stocks, which was responsible for nearly half the ytd gains in the s&p helped send global equities to repeated record levels this year, blindsided many investors after markets largely brushed aside last week’s trio of risk events. the question now, according to bbg, is whether the drops represent merely a pause or a more fundamental crack in the u.s. stock bull market. “there’s a chance u.s. internet technology stocks that have propelled a global stock rally will now serve as a buzz kill,” said mitsuo shimizu, deputy general manager at japan asia securities in tokyo. in an ominous note over the weekend, goldman warned that "" the last time the market acted like this was at the tech bubble peak "" suggesting more pain may be in store for tech stocks. now the good news : italian btps rally from the open, with the spread to bunds tightening 6bps due to poor performance from populist party in italian local election, further reducing chances of early national elections. it spurred on debt markets. italian government bond yields fell to their lowest since january.  ""macron doing well in the first round of the french parliamentary elections bodes well for him getting a majority,"" said lyn graham-taylor, fixed income strategist at rabobank. ""the fact that 5-star did poorly in local elections in italy also suggests a setback for populism in europe."" a similar reaction was observed in french bonds, where the spread to bunds has dropped to 36 bps after yesterday's landslide victory for macron's party in the first round of the french presidential election. in other key moves, the usd/jpy has broken back below 110.00 as usd weakens, aud/usd also supported by overnight rally in iron ore futures +2.6%. the short sterling strip bull flattens, with cable finally cracking below 1.27 after some initial support as markets continue to re-evaluate political certainty and brexit implications of u.k. election. meanwhile, the washington drama continues, with reports over the weekend that ag jeff sessions offered to speak to the senate intelligence committee to answer questions about alleged russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. on wednesday the federal reserve is set to lift rates , leading a pack of central banks that are mostly nodding in the direction of removing ultra-accommodative policy. the euro rose back to $1.1225 in the currency markets before fading modestly, where anticipation is also building ahead of wednesday's conclusion of a two-day fomc meeting. the central bank is widely expected to nudge up u.s. interest rates by another quarter point, but economists will be watching to see whether the recent dip in economic data and wave of uncertainty surround donald truump has weighed on confidence. britain's sterling also remained in focus as it began to backslide again. it was hovering at $1.2730 and 88.08 pence per euro as prime minister theresa may attempted to prop up her position after her party's last week's damaging election. ""the political risks are mounting,"" said kathleen brooks, head of research with city index in london. in commodities, crude oil prices extended gains after rising on friday when a pipeline leak in major producer nigeria overshadowed supply worries weighing on the market. u.s. crude and brent were both 0.6 percent higher at $46.10 and $48.45 a barrel, respectively, while copper rose for a fourth straight session and gold xau= snapped a three-day losing streak to climb to 1,269 an ounce bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot key overnight headlines asia equities traded subdued following a mixed us close on friday, in which tech underperformed as apple and fang stocks dropped over 3%, with participants also cautious ahead of this week's fomc meeting where the fed are expected to hike rates by 25bps. in asia, asx was closed for public holiday while nikkei 225 (-0.5%) was dampened by a mildly stronger jpy and after disappointing machinery orders. shanghai comp. (-0.5%) and hang seng (-1.1%) conformed to the downbeat risk tone with underperformance also seen in hk's tech stocks and after a lacklustre cny 40bin injection by the pboc. finally, 10yr jgbs were lower to track losses in t-notes and amid an absence of a boj rinban announcement today, while the curve was mixed with underperformance in the belly. pboc injected cny 10bin in 7-day reverse repos and cny 30bin in 28-day reverse repos. pboc set cny mid-point at 6.7948 (prey. 6.7971) top asian news in europe, exit polls from the first round of france's parliamentary election suggest macron's la republique en marche party is to win between 415-455 seats (out of 577), republicans 70-110 seats and national front with 1-5 seats. (newswires) note, 289 seats are require for an absolute majority. these results also exceed those expected by pollsters with the sopra steria poll forecasting 385-415 seats. italy's maverick 5-star movement looked set to suffer a severe setback in local elections on sunday, failing to make the run-off vote in almost all the main cities up for grabs, early results and exit polls said european trade has seen a quiet morning this morning, as traders look ahead to a week of central banks. following friday's sell off in tech names late in the us session, european suppliers of apple have notably underperformed this morning. politics continue to influence markets, as fallouts from the uk election continue, noticeably, uk pm may has stated that she intends to stay as prime minister despite the cabinet reshuffle. the cabinet shake up has seen michael gove back to an influential position, as the new environment secretary. the uncertainty continues in regards to brexit negotiations are evident in moody's commentary, stating that the election results open up consideration for a softer brexit. however, did state that the outcome will complicate and possibly delay negotiations. politics also dictate fixed income markets, as the german-italian spread falls around 14.8bps with the 10yr btp yield at its lowest since january, as 5-star movement party suffers a severe setback. elsewhere, the german-french spread slips 4.5bps as exit polls show macron's party winning a large majority of 415-455 in the parliamentary elections. top european news in commodities , oil prices continue to flounder, but amid some reports of decent selling interest this morning, buyers have contained the move ahead of the lower half of the usd45.00's in wti, but there looks to be limited prospect of a notable recovery as the demand and supply dynamics continues to dictate. russia’s energy minister said the market to re-balance by 1q 2018 after meeting with saudi arabian counterpart over weekend. hedge funds boost bullish wti bets ahead of flat price crash, with brent data due later monday. the overhang of us shale production eats away at the prospective imports, and this will weigh on prices for the foreseeable future. against this, we have seen a strong showing in copper this morning, moving back into the mid usd2.60's. nothing fresh to note from the demand side, ie china, so this may be a period of technical relief/recovery more than anything else. gold consolidates the recent pullback from near usd1300.00 levels, while silver is underperforming and looking a little heavy in the low usd17.00's. in currencies, there is not too much conviction in the fx markets this morning, and we include gbp in this given the heightened uncertainty over the next government make up, their stance going into the eu negotiations and the bargaining talks themselves. we pay little attention to the overhyped soft and hard brexit scenarios being touted by all and sundry, and the tight price action is testament to this. cable is testing the lows ahead of 1.2700 as ny traders filter in, but early london has been happy to maintain steady ranges a little higher up, preferring to express any weak gbp sentiment through the eur cross rate. the latter stalled just ahead of 0.8860 last week, and this looks to be the next port of call, with pre 0.8900 expected also at some point. this is also down to the buoyant tone in the eur/usd, which has re-establised a foothold above 1.1200 as the resistance ahead of 1.1300 is still the target. a breach looks unlikely ahead of the fomc this week, and much of the hesitation to commit this morning is largely down to this. us event calendar * * * db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap if a working lifetime starts from leaving university at 21 and ends with retirement at 65 then today's birthday marks the halfway stage of my career which seems quite daunting. my wife informed me last night that she hasn't managed to get me a birthday card or present yet as she's been exhausted. she was 25 weeks pregnant yesterday and is already bigger than when she delivered at full term with maisie. while i'm clearly hoping for a hot summer, i'm not sure it'll be worth it for me given the extra work i'll have to do! anyway, talking of university and linking it into the political shockwave that the uk delivered last week. i distinctly remember being at university back in the early 1990s and seeing pictures on the walls of students marching en masse on our campus at various causes in the 1970s. some pictures saw them occupying buildings in huge numbers in some kind of protest or another. fast forward 15-20 years to my time at uni and none of us had the appetite, enthusiasm or much cause for protest. i always wondered whether this was structural or cyclical. a combination of looking back through history and looking at the early data from last thursday's election suggests that it was cyclical. in the pdf today we show a graph of voter turnout of 18-24 years olds and over 65 year olds in every election since 1964 in the uk. as you can see the turnout for the eldest demographic has been steady between 70-80% over the 50+ years we have data. up until 1992, 18-24 year old turnout was a lower but relatively steady 60-68%. then in 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2010 it was at 54%, 40%, 38% and 52% respectively. early data from thursday have put this group's turnout at around 70% - possibly the highest in at least two generations. if confirmed this has major ramifications for politics and financial markets over the next few years in the uk and possibly further afield. in the uk we have huge intergenerational wealth issues (e.g. young in debt and can't afford to buy a house and the old with large wealth in their house and other asset) but if the young don't vote and the elderly do its difficult to see how this changes. however if the youth are now waking from their apathetic slumbering then policy surely has to be more redistributionary. given that you can't alienate the grey vote then the real difficulty is that politicians will struggle to tax the old but need to give the young more of a helping hand. this is not a recipe for austerity and debt reduction - both are looking increasingly like political suicide. as we've stated many times before over the last 12 months we think that over a long sweeping cycle we're at an inflexion point. in short governments can possibly be forced to spend more across the developed world until bond markets rebel at the high level of debts that this implies and then central banks would be forced to monetise this debt. thursday's election makes helicopter money more likely in my opinion. this is different from qe as its central banks buying bonds that are attached to fresh spending rather than independent of it. staying with politics, new french president macron is set for a big national assembly majority (as per reuters) in the first round of the legislative elections held yesterday. the second round will take place next week but markets are likely to be cheered that this will give him a mandate to make the reforms he's campaigned about. it seems mildly ironic that as france moves away from the socialist party, the uk is a small political mishap from fresh elections at any time and possibly electing the most socialist government for at least 40 years. we'll look at the market reaction to the uk election below but first we should highlight that in two days we have the small matter of the june fomc to look forward to. the fed is widely expected to raise interest rates 25 basis points and reiterate its intention to hike again once more before year end. they will also release updated economic and financial forecasts with db expecting only minor cosmetic changes with perhaps median 2017 headline and core inflation estimates nudged down a tenth but all other estimates, including the trajectory for interest rates likely to remain broadly similar. db also expect yellen to discuss tapering of reinvestments in her post-meeting press conference. while she will not likely commit to any specific details db expect her to guide financial markets toward a september announcement, which would be consistent with the minutes from the may 3 fomc meeting. onto markets and the big story on friday outside the uk election was the late sell-off in us tech which saw one measure of the sector down -2.7% with the nasdaq -1.8%.apple (-3.9%), facebook (-3.3%) and alphabet (-3.4%) were high profile losers on the day. it looked more like rotation than an out and out selloff as the dow (+0.4%) climbed and the s&p (-0.1%) was nearly unchanged. asian markets are starting the week on the soft side weighed down by friday's us tech sell off. the nikkei is -0.6%, the hang seng -1.2% and shanghai comp -0.45% lower as we type. elsewhere sterling retreated amid the political turmoil (-1.6% on friday but flat overnight) with gilt yields lower across the maturity spectrum (2y: -2bps; 10y: -3bps). however uk equities were boosted by the falling currency as the ftse 100 ended the day up +1.0% to end a string of four days of losses. european indices were higher (dax +0.8% and the cac 0.7%) and credit markets saw itraxx main and crossover both tighten by -1bp and -4bps respectively, while cdx ig and hy were flat and -2bps. turning to government bond markets, friday saw german 2y and 10y yields both tick up by +1bp, while us treasury yields rose (2y +2bps; 10y +1bps). french 10y yields were unchanged although the 2y  yields ticked up by +3bps, while btps rallied across maturities (10y: -8bps). across commodities markets, oil prices (and energy broadly) caught the risk rally as well (wti +0.7%). at the other end of the risk  spectrum gold fell for a third straight day (-0.6%). fx markets aside from the moves in gbp saw the us dollar broadly gain by +0.3% while the euro fell by -0.1%. while the primary focus on friday was on the uk election outcome, there was also a bit of data to follow. over in europe we got disappointing industrial production prints out of france and the uk. french industrial production numbers unexpectedly turned negative in april (-0.5% mom vs. +0.2% expected) and the uk data was also softer than expected (+0.2% mom vs. +0.7% expected). we also got trade data out of germany and the uk, where the trade surplus for the former shrunk more than expected to 18.1bn (vs. 23.0bn expected; 25.4bn previous) as imports grew more than expected at 1.2% mom (vs. -0.5% expected). the trade balance data out of the uk served to temper weak industrial production data as the total deficit narrowed to gbp -2.05bn in april (vs. -3.5bn expected; -3.9bn previous). it was a quiet day on the data

525,FX Week Ahead Preview: Focus Returns To The US Economy As Politics Run Riot Once Again,2017-06-11 23:20:00+00:00,"submitted by rajan dhall fxdaily.co.uk and shant movsesian of ransquawk fx week ahead: focus returns to the us economy as politics have run riot once again. theresa may clearly made a big mistake in calling the snap election, and the pound has suffered accordingly, though gains had perhaps run their course. nzd still looks good, while cad weathers oil price drop as domestic data supports. it is a key week for central banks next week, headlined by the fomc meeting on wednesday, which is widely expected to result in a 25bp rate hike as the fed maintain course for ‘normalisation’. in recent weeks, the run of data has been less than encouraging on the face of it, with wage growth sluggish given the average pace in job gains seen in the last year or so.  we had some tenuous signs that this may change over the course of the following few months with this week’s jolts rising significantly - above the 6 million mark – and there is a case to be made that employers could be struggling to find requisite skilled workers. the above alone will do little to revive the more aggressive rate path we had been looking to beyond june, and ahead of the fed meeting on wednesday, we have the latest cpi and retail sales figures for may, which will be something to consider alongside the rhetoric from the accompanying press conference.  industrial and manufacturing production stats on thursday also due.  little down on the political schedule which could impact on risk sentiment per say.  the jpy and chf having retreated some way – partly down to the ‘tame’ comey testimony - but the market should be on watch for any fresh ramifications after the ex-fbi director (and indeed some of the questioning senators) ‘highlighted’ his impromptu dismissal by president trump. having survived 109.00, friday trade saw usd/jpy pushing through the half way mark in the 110.00’s, but north of 111.00, we expect sellers to overwhelm once again.  this may prove to be a temporary affair, but with wall street still near record highs, the correlation with stocks may prompt buyers a little more actively into dips. there are more comfortable carry trades out there, with nzd/jpy seemingly top of the pile.  in nz next week, we have the q1 gdp release on wednesday which is seen rising from 0.4% to 0.7%, but the yoy rate is expected to remain at 2.7%.  amid the backdrop of the budget surpluses announced last month, the current account numbers may be of little interest the day before. across the waters, the australian week kicks off with a holiday on monday, in observance of the queen’s holiday. even so, the rba’s assistant governor debelle is down to speak that day, but data-wise thursday’s employment report is the main event.  with this relatively modest line-up of events, we expect a period of consolidation for aud, with downside exhaustion largely behind the recovery.  this ran out of steam well ahead of the 0.7600 mark, and this in spite of a strong pullback in copper price at the end of the week. aud/nzd is also at a key crossroads as fundamental differentials fight against the technical support from the weekly trend line seen below 1.0400.  a break under 1.0300 will see the market focusing on parity again! out of china, it is also worth noting industrial production for may, due out alongside retail sales which should remain strong given import data seen this week. fixed asset investment data also out. in japan, we cannot get excited above boj policy meetings these days, as the persistent flow of communication points to ongoing stimulus measures remaining in place amid subdued inflation. we also saw gdp slowing as q1 recorded a 0.3% rise vs 0.6% in q4 2016, but capex rose more than expected.  even so, economic traction looks some way off, and we are certainly nowhere near policy change any time soon. in europe, eu wide cpi at the end of the week (final reading) is standout, but after this week’s ecb meeting, where inflation forecasts have been downgraded, any weakness here will have been weathered to some degree, with the lead eur/usd rate still garnering bids on modest dips lower.  this is in anticipation of an eventual reining in of the extraordinary measures in place, deemed appropriate at the present time, but which was previously forecast (to change) in late q3 before some of the more eager proponents suggested we may have seen a stronger signal yesterday (thursday). this should also underpin eur/gbp, if not the general election result which proved to be a horrendous decision by theresa may.  far from providing stability into the brexit negotiations, which are (were?) scheduled to start on 19 june, the tories are now in a position where they needed to form an alliance, with the dup lining up as the number one contender despite their insistence on a more policy focused collaboration. for the pound, we see little light on the horizon near term, though going into the election we saw limited upside in cable given the already-tense relationship with europe after some of the recent exchanges, notably from brexit minister david davis (for now?) as well as the pm herself.  the spot rate had already run into a wall of selling interest north of 1.3000 in the weeks running up to the jun 8 vote, and despite the resilient tone overall, we could see a sea-change which could eventually return the pair back to circa 1.2400-1.2500 initially.  it will take a major breakthrough in the (eventual) talks ahead to see us get back to levels near 1.3000 again. eur/gbp levels of note on the upside lie ahead of 0.9000, with the large chunk of the resistance zone from 0.8800-60 worked through in the aftermath of the election result. pre 0.8650 looks strong on the downside, though any break below here will run into even stronger demand in the mid 0.8500’s. inflation, employment and retail sales stats all due for release out next week in the uk, and all are due out ahead of the boe meeting, with the central bank stance set to edge back towards a more neutral stance (lower for longer?) due to fresh political uncertainty. this week will have been another headache that governor carney and co could do well without, but if the pound can avoid any renewed bouts of sharp devaluation, the current policy stance will suffice. finally in canada, friday’s strong job report was further evidence that a moderate, slow-paced recovery could be developing. there are a number of external factors weighing on the domestic economy and the cad, but losses in oil price should be, and perhaps have been tempered by the recent boc statement which suggests the adjustment to current levels is largely complete. with wti falling back into the middle of the usd40-50 range, we have seen upturns in usd/cad to be a little more reluctant.  this was certainly the case towards 1.3600, so we are not averse to seeing a push lower towards 1.3100-1.3200, but demand either side of 1.3400 has been restrictive.  the nafta reset has also been a dark cloud hanging over canada, but we believe this will have greater ramifications for mexico, as the benefits of the accord have been largely beneficial to the us and canada in equal measure. no data of note next week in canada, so traders will focus more on oil price, but with a justifiable bias towards a more positive cad tone. cad/jpy has tested the support levels just under 81.00 again, and as we saw in mid-apr and mid-may, has found good support here to join nzd/jpy in showing healthy promise in the weeks ahead. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China Japan Testimony Central Banks fixed CPI Copper recovery BOE RANSquawk Mexico,1
546,Meet The 22 Economists That Want To Kill Your Purchasing Power,2017-06-11 03:11:00+00:00,"after the fed failed to spark any notable increase in aggregate demand despite keeping interest rates at zero for seven years, a group of economists is pressuring the central bank to rethink one of its most closely held-policy parameters. the group of 22 economists, which includes nobel laureate joseph stiglitz and former minneapolis fed president narayana kocherlakota, delivered a letter to the fed on friday pressuring it to appoint a blue-ribbon commission to reevaluate its policy targets in a way that’s transparent and also involves officials with a diversity of viewpoints. ultimately, the group hopes the central bank will reevaluate its inflation target, which has stood at just below 2% since 2012. borrowing the reasoning from a paper published by the san francisco fed earlier this year called “monetary policy in a low r-star world,” the group argued that structural shifts in the us economy appear to have shifted the real rate of interest permanently lower – and that the us economy can now tolerate higher inflation as a form of compensation. here's a passage from the letter: “even if a 2 percent inflation target set an appropriate balance a decade ago, it is increasingly clear that the underlying changes in the economy would mean that, whatever the correct rate was then, it would be higher today. to ensure the future effectiveness of monetary policy in stabilizing the economy after negative shocks – specifically, to avoid the zero lower bound on the funds rate – this fall in the neutral rate may well need to be met with an increase in the long-run inflation target set by the fed.” such a reassessment would be particularly appropriate now, the economists argue, because “the lack of evidence that moderately higher inflation would harm americans’ standard of living is juxtaposed with the tremendous evidence that a tighter labor market would improve americans’ standards of living.” some fed officials have already expressed tentative support for raising the inflation target, or at least changing the system by which the central bank’s parameters are set. williams noted the need for the fed “to adapt policy to changing economic circumstances” in his paper, and boston fed president eric rosengren has said that the fed should adapt policy to changing circumstances. vice fed chairman stanley fischer has praised the system adopted by the bank of canada, where policy targets are reviewed every five years, then re-set with the participation of the legislature. the argument for why a central bank should aim to push consumer prices even higher might seem obtuse to some readers - so kocherlakota explained his reasoning for signing the letter in a column published by bloomberg. raising the inflation target would give the fed more room to maneuver during the next slowdown by allowing it to focus on reining in inflation if benchmark rates are already low, kocherlakota said. “if, for example, people expect inflation to be 3 percent, then a zero nominal rate translates into a negative 3 percent real rate -- a full percentage point lower than the fed could achieve if expected inflation were 2 percent.” experience suggests the fed could use the support. during the most recent period of near-zero interest rates, the u.s. unemployment rate remained above 5 percent for nearly seven and a half years. and yellen has suggested that, if another recession takes the fed to the zero lower bound, the unemployment rate might stay above 5 percent for close to five years. but while the bureau of labor statistic’s seasonally adjusted cpi slumped to a 19-month low in april, other measures, like a gauge of consumer prices from pricestat, have consistently recorded higher levels of inflation. and regardless of what the rate of price growth is right now, the hard truth of the situation for many american workers is that real average wage growth is mired in the red while average household debt levels have climbed to record highs. while many would welcome higher wages and better jobs, the relationship between inflation and employment – as janet yellen herself admitted – has seemingly broken down. whether the central bank can successfully push inflation higher is up for debate; it has struggled in recent years – despite pumping trillions of dollars into the economy. but regardless, higher consumer prices are not what americans need right now. in addition to stiglitz and kocherlakota, the letter a signed by dean baker from the center of economic and policy research, heather boushey, from washington center for equitable growth, brad delong, university of california, berkeley, joseph gagnon, peterson institute, lawrence mishel, economic policy institute, william spriggs, howard university, valerie wilson, economic policy institute, gene sperling, obama administration economist, jared furman, peterson institute, marc jarsulic, center for american progress, lawrence bell, johns hopkins university, josh bivens, economic policy institute, tim duy, university of oregon, manuel pastor, university of southern california, mark thoma, university of oregon, justin wolfers, university of michigan, david blanchflower, dartmouth college, mike konczal, roosevelt institute, michael madowitz, center for american progress. ***** read the full text of the letter below: dear chair yellen and the board of governors, the end of this year will mark ten years since the beginning of the great recession. this recession and the slow recovery that followed was extraordinarily damaging to the livelihoods and financial security of tens of millions of american households. accordingly, it should provoke a serious reappraisal of the key parameters governing macroeconomic policy. one of these key parameters is the rate of inflation targeted by the federal reserve. in years past, a 2 percent inflation target seemed to give ample leverage with which the fed could lower real interest rates. but given the evidence that the equilibrium interest rate had fallen substantially even prior to the financial crisis, and that the fed’s short-term policy rate remained at zero for seven years without sparking any large acceleration of aggregate demand growth, a reassessment of this target seems warranted. such a reassessment is particularly appropriate when the lack of evidence that moderately higher inflation would harm americans’ standard of living is juxtaposed with the tremendous evidence that a tighter labor market would improve americans’ standards of living. some federal reserve policymakers have acknowledged these shifting realities and indicated their willingness to reconsider the appropriate target level. for example, san francisco federal reserve president john williams noted the need for central banks to “adapt policy to changing economic circumstances,” in suggesting a higher inflation target, and boston federal reserve president eric rosengren cited the different context in which the inflation target was set in emphasizing the need for debate about the right target. in may, vice chair stanley fischer highlighted the canadian system of reconsidering the inflation target every five years, saying, “i can envisage – say, in the case of inflation targeting – a procedure in which you change the target or you change the other variables that are involved on some regular basis and through some regular participation.” the comments made by fischer, rosengren, and williams all underscore the ample evidence that the long-term neutral rate of interest may have fallen. even if a 2 percent inflation target set an appropriate balance a decade ago, it is increasingly clear that the underlying changes in the economy would mean that, whatever the correct rate was then, it would be higher today. to ensure the future effectiveness of monetary policy in stabilizing the economy after negative shocks – specifically, to avoid the zero lower bound on the funds rate – this fall in the neutral rate may well need to be met with an increase in the long-run inflation target set by the fed. more immediately, new, post-crisis economic conditions suggest that a reiteration of the meaning of the fed’s current target is in order. in its 2016 statement of long-run goals and strategy, the federal open market committee wrote: “the committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.” some fomc participants, however, appear to instead consider 2 percent a hard ceiling that should never be breached, and justify their decision-making on that basis. it is important that the federal reserve makes clear – and operates policy based on – its stated goal that it aims to avoid inflation being either below or above its target. economies change over time. recent decades have seen growing evidence that developed economies have harder times generating faster growth in aggregate demand than in decades past. policymakers must be willing to rigorously assess the costs and benefits of previously-accepted policy parameters in response to economic changes. one of these key parameters that should be rigorously reassessed is the very low inflation targets that have guided monetary policy in recent decades. we believe that the fed should appoint a diverse and representative blue ribbon commission with expertise, integrity, and transparency to evaluate and expeditiously recommend a path forward on these questions. we believe such a process will strengthen the fed as an institution and its conduct of monetary policy, and help ensure wise policymaking for the years and decades to come. the endgame, of course, is to pay off the old 'expensive' dollars with new 'cheap' dollars... quietly taxing the citizenry to death... tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com

557,"Goldman: ""The Last Time The Market Acted Like This Was At The Tech Bubble Peak""",2017-06-10 23:15:00+00:00,"yesterday's dramatic ""rotational"" divergence between tech stocks and the rest of the market, which as sentiment trader pointed out the only time in history when the dow jones closed at a new all time high while the nasdaq dropped 2% was on april 14, 1999, stunned many and prompted bloomberg to write that ""a crack has finally formed in the foundation of the u.s. bull market. now investors must decide if any structural damage has been done."" this year’s hottest stocks, companies from facebook inc. and apple inc. to netflix inc. and nvidia corp., buckled friday, spurring losses that sent the nasdaq 100 to its biggest drop relative to the dow jones industrial average since 2008. an alternative explanation is that the purge in tech stocks, responsible for half the market's gains in 2017... ... was long overdue, and followed not only virtually every hedge fund piling into tech stocks in the first quarter, resulting in the tech sector becoming the "" most overweight it has ever been "" according to bank of america, but also followed the biggest weekly outflow from the tech sector xlk etf in over a year. ten days ago we highlighted a quote from miller tabak's matt maley who said ""everybody remembers 2000, so they might be getting a little nervous with this development. i just wonder how many people have said to themselves, ‘if amzn gets to $1,000, i’m going to take at least some profits.’” to which we said "" and another question: now that the first sellers have emerged, will the herd follow... "" just over a week later, it did, resulting in amazon flash crashing by nearly $50 from its intraday highs, and dethroning jeff bezos from the rank of world's second wealthiest man . so what prompted the unexpected tech crash rotation, and amzn flash smash? there were plenty of theories, some pointing to a bearish tweet by citron's andrew left who complained about “frenzied casino action” in nvidia. a previously discussed report by goldman sachs which warned about an ""air pocket in tech valuations"" did not help, although the most likely reason was a long-overdue rotation out of growth/momentum stocks which as we showed one week ago, has trounced the ""value"" factor in 2017. incidentally the right question is not what caused the selloff, but what prompted the unprecedented pile up into tech stock to begin with, something rbc's charlie mcelligott has been warning about for months. overnight, goldman's chief equity strategist also opined on the matter, piling on some more gloom for tech bulls, and warning that while the ""economic environment has proven just right for technology and other secular growth stocks"" the "" perfect fairy tale scenario for tech is unlikely to last "" amid signals inside the market point to slowing growth. discussing the shifting economic outlook in 2017, which started off with a bang on hopes of a trump-driven reflation, which has seen been fully unwound amid fears of a deflationary bust, kostin says that the unexpected mix of healthy growth and declining rates represents a goldilocks scenario for us equities. growth data has certainly not been too cold, supporting s&p 500 eps growth of 14% in 1q and consensus expectations for 11% growth in both 2017 and 2018. nor have conditions run too hot and caused the rise in rates that we expected would constrain equity valuations this year. instead, the economic backdrop has proven just right. however, the current ""goldilocks"" scenario - not only for tech stocks but the broader market - also carries with it the seeds of its own destruction according to goldman, which maintains its year end target for the s&p at 2,300 or 5.5% lower from here. as goldman cautions, "" just like in the fairy tale, this perfect scenario is unlikely to last. with the economy at full employment, an easy fed risks the possibility that wage pressures build and weigh on corporate profit margins. our base case is that above-trend economic growth will eventually push inflation higher, prompt an accelerated pace of fed tightening, and lead to higher bond yields that will reduce equity valuations . as the cycle matures, we expect us equity prices will continue to rise, but we think that the trajectory of price gains will be slower than the pace of earnings growth as monetary policy and valuation multiples each normalize ."" that's the upside scenario. goldman also concedes there is an alternative world in which it is wrong about growth and inflation picking up: conversely, if the current market outlook for low rates and inflation is proven correct, it will likely accompany a significant slowdown in the pace of economic growth . this scenario is potentially less friendly for equities given the negative earnings revisions that likely would result from a weakening economic environment. kostin admits that so far the market finds itself in the latter camp, as ""the outperformance of ndx, “faamg” (fb, aapl, amzn, msft, and googl) and other growth stocks also supports the idea of decelerating economic growth"" and explains ""growth stocks typically outperform when there is a scarcity of economic growth. this cycle’s prolonged length and slow economic growth help explain why value stocks have underperformed growth stocks to such a large extent during recent years and ytd in 2017."" there is more confusion. last week we again showed that , in a paradoxical outcome, the fed's 2 recent rate hikes have resulted in the loosest financial conditions observed since 2014. as deutsche bank calculated , the fed's ""tightening"" since the december 2016 fomc meeting is the equivalent to one 25bp rate cut , even though the fed has raised twice over this period . kostin touches on this divergence too, and writes that "" perhaps most remarkable is the outperformance of stocks with strong balance sheets alongside a rallying equity market and extremely easy financial conditions. falling rates, tight credit spreads, a slipping usd, and high equity prices have brought the goldman sachs financial conditions index to its lowest level in two years ."" to goldman this is a puzzle, as its basket of s&p 500 firms with strong balance sheets (gsthsbal) has outperformed its weak balance sheet basket (gsthwbal) by 520 bp during the last six months. as kostin explains outperformance of strong balance sheet companies - usually tech-linked names that have little or no debt and substantial cash flow - in a 10%+ equity market rally is rare; occurring in only 5% of six-month stretches in the last 30 years. the punchline: "" the last such notable episode was in 2000, at the tech bubble peak."" of course, it is worth noting that goldman is axed in this trade because if there is anything that will send the s&p sliding and hitting goldman's year end target of 2,300 it is a selloff in tech (and other strong balance sheet companies), which as noted above, are responsible for half the market's ytd gains. and while normally we would caution that the fed may simply step in during any concerted selloff amid the broader market (catalyzed by the tech sector) as it has every single time in the past, this time it may let gravity take hold: after all, not only did the fed caution during its last fomc minutes that elevated asset prices have resulted in "" increased vulnerabilities "" and that "" asset valuation pressures in some markets were notable "", but as goldman also warned recently , yellen may be looking for just the right ""shock"" with which to reaffirm control over a market which is now interpreting a rate hike as an easing signa (see "" goldman asks if yellen has lost control of the market, warns of fed ""policy shock ""). it is hardly a secret that most goldman recommendations in recent years have a been a dud, but just maybe this time it is different. the bank's long-suffering clients - most of whom find themselves on the opposite side of the bank's prop trading desk - will certainly be grateful. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Apple Bank of America goldman sachs Goldman Sachs Bank of America Nasdaq 100 Monetary Policy Sentiment Trader Bond Dow Jones Industrial Average NASDAQ Prop Trading Deutsche Bank Goldilocks,1
817,One Bank Is Confused: The Fed's Rate Hikes Have Resulted In The Loosest Financial Conditions Since 2014,2017-06-06 14:19:00+00:00,"in its latest weekly economic indicators update, goldman charts the ongoing paradoxical divergence between the fed's professed tightening path and what is actually taking place in the us stock market, where it finds that financial conditions are the easiest they have been in two years. one month ago, goldman discussed this topic in depth when jan hatzius implicitly asked if yellen has lost control of the market, and warned that in order to normalize fin conditions, the fed may be forced to follow through with a ""policy shock."" overnight, deutsche bank also focused on the ongoing divergence between fed intentions and market reality, noting that despite another weak q1 for us growth and several soft inflation prints in recent months, ""the fed has for the most part stuck to the script for policy over the remainder of the year."" the german bank notes  ""recent communication has continued to signal that at least one rate hike – the first likely coming at next week's june fomc meeting – and a reduction in the balance sheet are still likely by year-end."" it posits one reason why the fed has remained on message "" is that financial conditions have persistently eased despite two rate hikes since december. in fact, our financial conditions index has recently neared the loosest (i.e., most supportive of growth) levels since 2014. "" we consider these questions through the lens of our financial conditions index (fci). in brief, our high-frequency fci is a composite of various financial market indicators – the trade-weighted dollar, equities, the 10-year treasury term premium, vix, mortgage spread, and corporate bond spread. the variables are transformed when needed (e.g., by taking growth rates), standardized by their pre-crisis mean and standard deviation, and then aggregated into an index using weights based on each variable's historical relative ability to forecast out-ofsample real gdp growth. the index is constructed such that positive values indicate that financial conditions are supportive of growth, while negative values are consistent with tight financial conditions that exert a drag on growth. it's not just db's (and goldman's) own calculations that reveal an easing in financial conditions: ""the supportive trend in financial conditions evident in our fci is not dependent on the methodology we use to construct our index. indeed, the signals from various alternative fcis – including from bloomberg and the chicago, kansas city and st. louis federal reserve banks – are similar: financial conditions have eased materially in recent months even as the fed has raised rates ."" so the next question, as asked by goldman one month ago, is "" what does this easing mean for the fed? "" here is db's answer: one way to approach this question is to translate the move in our fci into a ""fed funds equivalent."" we do this by comparing the gdp implications from recent changes in our fci – based on a regression of real gdp growth on our fci with lags – to the impact of fed rate hikes on real gdp growth. to pin down the latter, we use simulations from the fed's model of the us economy (frb/us) which suggest that a 100bp cut in the fed funds rate boosts real gdp growth over the coming year by about 0.5 percentage points. since the fed raised rates in december 2016, our fci has risen by about 0.35 index points. based on a regression, this rise in the fci would tend to add about 0.2 percentage points to real gdp growth during this quarter and in q3, after which the impact on growth would dissipate. the boost to growth over the nex four quarters from this easing in financial conditions is equivalent to about one fed rate cut of 25bp. in addition to supporting the baseline near-term growth outlook, there is evidence that financial conditions provide important information about the risks around the outlook, with loose conditions reducing downside risks to growth. simply said, in terms of its impact on real gdp growth, the fed's ""tightening"" since the december 2016 fomc meeting is the equivalent to one 25bp rate cut, even though the fed has raised twice over this period. the conclusion: the divergence can't - and won't - continue, and ""whether or not this easing of financial conditions persists as the fed continues to raise rates and also begins to unwind its balance sheet will be an important factor in whether the market or the fed view proves correct about monetary policy in 2018.

885,"The Answer To El-Erian's Quandary: It's ""A Perfect Storm"" Melt Up",2017-06-05 14:53:00+00:00,"on friday, pimco's mohamed el-erian referenced one of our recent charts showing the dramatic divergence between treasury yields and stocks, which he said ""this (simple yet powerful) chart from @zerohedge warrants a phd thesis in finance."" this (simple yet powerful) chart from @zerohedge warrants a phd thesis in #finance #stocks #bonds #markets pic.twitter.com/w61rdbfkpt — mohamed a. el-erian (@elerianm) june 2, 2017 roughly at the same time not one but two banks offered their own ""dissertations"" on el-erian's thesis, first deutsche bank, then bank of america. as db's dominic konstam wrote in response to the ongoing paradoxical divergence, "" we think equities continue to move higher and bond yields lower . 10s haven’t yet convincingly broken below 2.15 percent but we stick with the success so far in the excess liquidity-yield momentum model that suggests they will and they ought to move to 2 percent or below."" according to konstam, there "" seems to be a perfect storm of so so growth and falling inflation, enough for the fed to tighten modestly but being at risk of over doing it. the net impact is for financial conditions to ease via the soft dollar as term premium is tied down. and it is hard to see the fed either taking a time out or accelerating tightening for fear of same said error."" echoing something goldman asked several months ago when jan hatzius pointed out that the fed's rate hike led to the biggest easing in financial conditions on record, db also noted that "" the easing in our financial conditions index is one of the most extremes on record, thanks to fed tightening! ""  and, as db adds, the softer dollar ""should give draghi sufficient cover to remain dovish"", not to mention keep pressure on the pboc to raise the yuan against the declining dollar, something which sparked tremendous fx fireworks over the past week. some more details: we think equities continue to move higher and bond yields lower. financial conditions continue to soften. our index was at peak tightening in january 2016, the index level was at -1.53 with the previous peak tightness -1.73 in february 2011, before twist and -3.29 october 2008. the recent local peak softness was november 2016 (-0.71). since then the softening has been driven mainly by dollar weakness, contributing 47 percent of the easing in financial conditions. mortgage spread narrowing and some recovery in fx reserves have each contributed another 20 percent or so in softer conditions1 while equities 7 percent. the irony is that faster fed tightening has neatly coincided with an easing of financial conditions. one might be tempted to suggest that if the fed wants to tighten financial conditions for fear of overheating the economy, it is going about it the wrong way. the logic here is that the (rates) market remains fearful that the fed’s push for normalization runs the risk of lower inflation and weaker real growth that will undermine equity valuations. the self-inoculating response is therefore lower rates (5 years and out) and as we wrote last week, bonds act as a crutch to equities – equities are anyway cheap and whatever is good for the bond market at least since 2008 has never been sustainably bad for the equity market konstam follow up with a critical discussion of what it would take for the fed to burst the equity bubble, but has so far refrained from doing so, which in turn prompted goldman one month ago to ask if yellen has lost control of the market (and warned of ""policy shock""), to wit: ironically, if the fed wants to tighten financial conditions two possibilities would be an overt policy error to be much more aggressive and short circuit the mild expansion but without the smoking gun of inflation – that should see equity declines despite lower long dated yields with spread widening . ironically the dollar might weaken as an offset. or go the other extreme and take a time out to be more overtly behind the curve and allow higher inflation expectations via a steeper curve that might raise the dollar, soften equities and spreads (hunt for yield dissipates). neither of these directions is necessarily guaranteed to succeed nor appear particularly appealing – and arguably the recent faster pace of tightening was supposed to look a bit like the former but is clearly back firing. the conclusion is that the fed can’t do a lot that appears credible to the market. the path of least resistance is therefore a soggy dollar, low yields and robust equities. in a tangential discussion of why the fed may be trapped this time around, over the weekend one river cio eric peter brought up a different issue , one which suggests that the fed is terrified of an aggressive tightening cycle for one reason: china. ""classic late-cycle action,” said the cio. “vol-compression, loosening financial conditions, and a pain-trade that tilts forever higher,” he continued. “normally the fed ends it. hiking aggressively, flattening the curve, widening credit spreads, and then the economy rolls.” but this cycle is not quite like the others. “the real credit excesses haven’t been created here, they’ve formed in china, which leaves the fed in a quandary.” much as the fed would like to have jurisdiction over every corner of global finance, they no longer control china. finally, in a note on friday after the payrolls report which sent yields tumbling and stocks to new all time highs, bofa's hans mikkelsen had the simplest possible explanation: "" all news is [again] good news"" this is what the bofa credit strategist said: "" may’s jobs report – with lower than expected headline jobs growth of 147k, negative revisions of -66k and downward revisions to wages - represents another piece in a string of disappointing hard economic data. impressively, even though stocks initially struggled and declined with rates, eventually they turned around and closed up 0.37% on the day (figure 1) ."" it got better with bofa noting the patently obvious, namely that "" clearly, equities continue to respond well to both positive and negative economic data, as the latter leads to a more dovish monetary policy stance. while the fed appears determined to hike in two weeks (figure 2), it appears that the relevant risk is they do not - or more likely deliver a dovish hike by using language in the statement/talking dovishly at the press conference. for next week, our european economists are looking for the ecb to downplay downside risks and give a slightly more balanced assessment. however, also there the risks are skewed toward a more dovish outcome (see: ecb: baby steps towards normalization). remain bullish on hg spreads. in short, the ""phd thesis"" answer mohamed appears to be looking for is that the record liquidity glut continues to push risk higher, with the result that whether good or bad news, stocks continues to make all time highs even as the divergence between bonds and stocks grows to unprecedented levels. perhaps a far better finance thesis is how much longer will the fed allow this particular divergence to continue , although our advice is not to seek an answer from the fomc committee, whose actions have allowed this financial paradox to emerge in the first place. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Bank of America China Bank of America Twitter Jan Hatzius Monetary Policy Bond Yuan recovery Deutsche Bank Twitter,1

gbp/usd fills gap to friday close, after opening lower in asia following saturday’s attacks bloomberg observes. european equity markets lower from the open, oil-related stocks underperform given heightened political uncertainty. banco popular in spain trades -11% after reports of liquidity pressure due to deposit withdrawals. core fixed income markets edge lower, german long-end steepens, some focus on wage pressures within pmi data. mxn leads emfx higher as ruling party is projected to win state election. european stocks are down, with the stoxx europe 600 lower by 0.2% with miners the biggest losers following a downgrade, while zinc and tin led base metals lower. europe was dragged lower by the basic resources index which drops as much as 1.3% to one-month low, making biggest decline of 19 industry groups, after hsbc cuts valuations for london-traded mining companies, downgrades antofagasta, kaz minerals. antofagasta is biggest decliner in sector, falls 2.8%, centamin -2%, arcelormittal -1.6%, anglo american -1%. hsbc cuts lse equities valuations by 4%-9% on assumption of stronger gbp/usd conversion rate, used to convert usd-denominated cash flows to gbp, bank’s analysts write in note monday. the big event of the session was the sharp shift in gulf balance of power with geopolitics surging to the top of the agenda as investors digest the move by saudi arabia, bahrain, the united arab emirates and egypt to suspended air and sea travel to and from qatar. saudi arabia cited qatar’s support of “terrorist groups aiming to destabilize the region .” which is ironic considering that a leaked memo by hillary clinton last year exposed both saudi arabia and qatar as the two big state sponsors of regional terrorism. following the report, qatar stocks have plunged over 7%, the biggest one day drop since december 2014 to the lowest since january 2016... ... while qatar bond yield have surged in the worst day in 7 months... ... and qatar cds spiked to 2 month highs. terror was also in focus in europe following an attack at a popular london nightlife spot days before a national election. crude initially recovered some of friday’s slump, although it has since filled the gap, while stocks in qatar plunged as the market digested the fallout from the unexpected diplomatic twist. treasury yields remained near the lowest in seven months after u.s. jobs data missed forecasts last week. the peso rallied on signs the ruling pri was ahead in the governor’s election for the key state of mexico. while the fed has entered a blackout period ahead of next week's rate decision, there is plenty of data in the coming days, with the headline being former fbi director james comey's testimony before congress following his dismissal by donald trump. u.k. voters go to the polls thursday. surveys of voters over the past few weeks have indicated a tightening race, increasing the chance that prime minister theresa may might not get an increased majority. policy decisions from central banks in india and australia are due during the week, as well as data on chinese trade and inflation, u.s. factory orders, european industrial output figures and gdp reports for australia, japan and the euro area. in fx, the bloomberg dollar spot index dropped 0.2 percent, adding to a 0.4 percent decline on friday. the yen fell 0.1 percent to 110.53 per dollar. japan’s currency climbed 0.9 percent friday after the u.s. data. the mexican peso soared 1.6 percent, reversing an earlier drop. president enrique pena nieto’s party is narrowly ahead in the election for governor of mexico’s largest state in an official quick count, throwing it a lifeline ahead of next year’s general vote. follow more on the vote here. the pound traded 0.1 percent weaker, paring its earlier loss. the euro also fell 0.1 percent to $1.1268. in commodities, wti crude was 0.5% lower to $47.46, after dropping 1.5 percent on friday. gold rose as much as 0.2 percent to $1,282.1 an ounce, hitting the highest since april. tin fell 1 percent to $20,090 a ton and zinc traded 1.4 percent lower at $2,494.5 a ton on the london metal exchange. in rates, the yield on 10-year treasury notes rose one basis point to 2.17 percent after dropping five basis points on friday. u.k. benchmark yields climbed two basis points. bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot top overnight headlines via bbg looking at regional markets, we start in asia which dismissed the positive wall st. close on friday, to trade with a cautious tone after saturday's terrorist attack in london and as the region reacted to the miss on us nfp data. asx 200 (-0.7%) underperformed with financials heavily weighing on the index amid weakness across banks, while nikkei 225 (+0.1%) recovered from opening losses after usd/jpy rebounded from its lows. elsewhere, shanghai comp. (-0.5%) and hang seng (-0.3%) failed to benefit from an improvement in caixin services and composite pmi figures, as the pboc remained steadfast in its prudent and neutral policy stance. specifically, pboc deputy governor chen stated the pboc will neither be tight or loose in terms of monetary policy and will remain neutral and prudent. also in china, the caixin services pmi for may printed at 52.8 (prey. 51.5); a 4-month high; chinese caixin composite pmi (may) 51.5 (prey. 51.2) pboc injected cny 40bin in 7-day reverse repos and cny 30bin in 28-day reverse repos. pboc set cny mid-point at 6.7935 (prey. 6.8070) finally, 10yr jgbs were mildly higher alongside the cautious tone in markets, although upside was capped following a lack of rinban announcement from the boj, while the curve slightly flattened amid outperformance in the super long-end. top asian news in europe it has been a relatively quiet affair amid market closures due to whit monday. additionally, investors are hovering on the sidelines as they await key releases later in the week (uk election and ecb decision). as such, eu bourses have been directionless, with focus on tensions rising in the middle east as several nations including saudi arabia cut diplomatic ties with qatar, after they are alleged to support terrorists. subsequently, crude prices jumped over 1% in asian trade with speculation that this might lead to an impact on oil and lng supplies. similarly, fixed income markets are also subdued with bunds off by around 20 ticks, taking the lead from usts, while the german curve is showing some modest steepening. levels of support to the downside reside around 162.45 with the former high situated at 162.15 top european news in currencies, it has been relatively subdued this morning in fx, with some of the expectant market drivers not playing out as one would expect. given the terror attack in london and some of the latest election polls showing gap narrowing (to a significant degree in some cases), gbp held up well this morning, perhaps in anticipation of a strong uk services pmi number. however, this came in softer than expected, though remains comfortably in the expansionary zone, printing 53.8 vs 55.8 previously. cable has since pushed above 1.2900 again, tentatively so as yet, but eur/gbp is also lower to test initial support ahead of 0.8700. the data alone was cause near term gbp weakness, so we can only put these moves down to an expected tory victory on thursday. elsewhere, oil prices have risen due to the severing of diplomatic ties with qatar from some of the leading arab countries. allegations over links to terrorism have prompted this, and the push up in wti and brent have assisted cad and nok to a moderate degree. as for the usd majors, near term trade is extremely tight, with eur/usd refusing to give up ground in the mid 1.1200's, while usd/jpy continues to find buyers ahead of 110.00. treasury yields stagnant, albeit at lower levels. in commodities, the focus is on oil this morning as the allegations of terrorism links made on qatar have led to six arab countries including saudi and egypt to sever diplomatic ties. qatar has denied this, but uncertainty has lifted oil price levels to a modest degree, with supply side concerns still weighing on wti to keep trade below the mid usd48.00 mark. brent is above usd50.00, but is struggling to maintain a foothold, so the inventory data this week could be significant after the notable draw downs reported last week. these latest developments have also put a fresh bid under precious metals, as gold is now eyeing a move into the upper usd1280's. silver has tipped over usd17.50. base metals remain heavy though, with zinc the underperformer today. nickel still pressured since its loss of the 9000 handle, but off the lows. copper is still hemmed inside usd2.50-2.60, with a test on the lower end of the limits rebuffed for now. on today's calendar, we will get the remaining pmis as well as final revisions to q1 unit labour costs and nonfarm productivity, ism non-manufacturing for may, factory orders for april and final durable and capital goods orders revisions for april us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap a sobering weekend for londoners. was very shocked at the attack on london bridge on saturday especially as i walked across it on friday. as i was walking i was remembering the shocking westminster bridge attack in march and thought that the pedestrian walkway was so wide and so easy to access from the road that this could sadly be an easy target for a copycat attack. i even moved well away from the side of the road and closer to the river to be what i thought at the time was excessively cautious and paranoid. so i was quite shocked that just over 24 hours later the attackers chose that area to terrorise the capital. i heard the news seconds after watching the most heart-warming film i'd seen for a while called lion. if you need cheering up then watch it and i challenge anyone not to have at least one tear in the eye at some point during the film. anyway life goes on and although this tragic event will get headlines markets will move on to what is a busy week. as we dubbed it last week we have super thursday to look forward to with the uk election, the ecb meeting where hints of a policy shift may take place and also the testimony from comey before the senate that could be embarrassing as a minimum for mr trump. we'll preview the ecb in more detail on thursday but in brief our economists have changed their ecb call. they now think the balance of probabilities have shifted away from a change to forward guidance so soon with the soft may flash inflation print last week perhaps helping to offset confidence in the growth outlook. they still expect some soft exit expectations management, for example, talking up economic growth and tasking the internal committees to consider the options for forward guidance, deposit rate and qe. before this today we'll see the final services pmis from around the globe and the equivalent ism in the us. this morning we’ve already had the caixin release out of china where, in contrast to the disappointing manufacturing reading, the services print rose by an impressive 1.3pts to 52.8 in may and the highest since january. that reading has helped support a rise in the composite to 51.5 from 51.2. this, combined with the rest of the data today will be another good real time gauge of activity after a confusing payroll report on friday which led to a strong end to the week for fixed income. before we recap that though, it’s worth noting that the other breaking news to report this morning is that saudi arabia, uae, bahrain and egypt have all cut diplomatic ties with qatarwith air and sea travel to the gulf state also suspended. according to bloomberg the move is related to qatar’s backing of iranian-backed terrorism activity in the region. it’s a developing story so the details are fairly light as we go to print though. there’s been some reaction in markets. wti (+1.28%) and brent oil (+1.22%) had already moved higher prior to the headlines hitting but are now even firmer while gold is +0.10%. equity markets in  asia are however flat to slightly weaker with financials lagging under the pressure of falling bond yields. middle eastern bourses are not yet open. in fx sterling is down -0.20% following the weekend events. back to payrolls. the data revealed headline growth of just 138k for may which compared to the consensus estimate of 182k, while there was a further net 66k of downward revisions to the prior two months also made. that means that over the last three months the average increase in nonfarm payrolls is just 121k, down from as high as 201k in february. the current three-month moving average is also at the lowest reading since july 2012. the difference now however is that the unemployment rate is much lower with the rate down to just 4.3% in may (from 4.4% in april) and the lowest since may 2001. the move lower last month was partly helped by a two-tenths decline in the participation rate to 62.7% however it’s worth noting that this rate has largely stayed in a 62.5-63.0% range for 20 months now despite some month to month volatility. so while a disappointing headline payrolls figure, it does possibly reflect the struggle to hire as we get closer to full employment. as our us economists also note, there simply is not enough excess slack left in the labour market to produce the sort of job gains that we have experienced in the past so employment growth is poised to slow further going forward. to that point, the dallas fed’s kaplan said following the employment report that “there are dramatically more skilled job openings in the us than there are workers” and that “while there is slack, it is dwindling”. it’s worth also noting that the other important element of the employment report – wages growth – was a bit soft in may. while average hourly earnings rose +0.2% mom and matching expectations, april was revised down a tenth and the annual rate held steady at +2.5% yoy versus expectations for a one-tenth rise to +2.6%. as mentioned earlier fixed income markets seemingly picked up on some of the softer elements of the data with 5y, 10y and 30y treasury yields falling 4.3bps, 5.2bps and 5.3bps respectively, while the usd index also hit the lowest since october last year. the short end of the treasury curve did however pare back an initial move lower with 2y yields eventually closing unchanged. with bloomberg’s calculator also showing that a june rate hike is around 90% priced in this morning, the data hasn't yet influenced the market's expectations of next week's fomc too much as yet. meanwhile core yields were also lower in europe on friday. benchmark yields in germany, france, uk and netherlands were between 2bps and 4bps lower although the periphery was a little weaker with yields 1bp to 3bps higher. as we noted last week most bond markets are either at or very close to the bottom end of the three-month range for yields. in fact despite us equities hitting new highs on friday (s&p 500 +0.37% and +0.96%  for the week, dow +0.29% and +0.60%) and european markets also enjoying a solid end to the week (stoxx 600 +0.23% and +0.31%), last week was actually a pretty strong one for most bond markets too which more than likely reflects some of the benign inflation data we got. benchmark 10y treasury yields were 8.7bps lower over the week and at the lowest yield this year (2.159%) while 10y bund yields were down 5.6bps over the week and have now fallen for 4 weeks in a row. at 0.272% they still have a bit of work to do to get down to the 2017 lows of 0.156% but they are down from as high as 0.452% just last month. last week was a similar story too for the likes of france (-4.7bps), switzerland (-5.9bps) and the netherlands (-5.1bps). two markets which stand out for bucking that trend though are btps (+16.4bps) and gilts (+2.5bps) where domestic political situations continue to dominate those markets. with regards to the latter, the last couple of opinion polls continue to point towards a tighter race ahead of thursday. the latest yougov/times poll conducted over 1-2 june shows the tories as holding a 4%  lead over labour at 42-38% which is unchanged from the last poll. meanwhile the survation/mail on sunday poll (conducted on 3 june) showed a lead of just 1% for the tories at 40-39%. that is the smallest lead for the conservatives of any opinion poll we’ve seen so far. other polls continue to have a bigger lead for the tories but the gap has seemingly narrowed over the course of the campaign. the only other news to report from the weekend is the latest world bank economic forecasts. released yesterday, the world bank expects the global economy to grow 2.7% in 2017 driven by a recovery in us, europe and advanced economies, followed by 2.9% in 2018. those forecasts are unchanged versus the january estimates. in terms of the other news from friday, philadelphia fed president harker (a voter this year) reiterated his call for a further two rate hikes this year. he said that concern about recent lower than expected inflation outcomes was unwarranted and also that payrolls gains in the range of roughly 100k a month is all that is required to achieve full-employment. meanwhile there was a bit of focus on a ny times article which suggested that president trump is likely to nominate monetary economist marvin goodfriend and former treasury department official randal quarles to fill two of the three vacant governor positions on the fed’s board. the article suggested that quarles would likely become a leading figure in the administration’s efforts to roll back financial regulation and also be nominated to serve as the fed’s vice-chair for  supervision. meanwhile goodfriend, who is also a former fed official, is said to support a more rules based policy approach. to the week ahead now. this morning we’re kicking off in europe with the remaining services and composite may pmis which will also include a first look at the data for the uk and periphery. over in the us this afternoon we also receive the remaining pmis as well as final revisions to q1 unit labour costs and nonfarm productivity, ism non-manufacturing for may, factory orders for april and final durable and capital goods orders revisions for april. with little of significance in asia on tuesday we are straight to europe with the june sentix investor confidence reading and april retail sales for the euro area. in the us tomorrow we are due to get jolts job openings for april. wednesday kicks off in germany with april factory orders, while in the uk we get the may house prices data. the only data due in the us on wednesday is april consumer credit. china will also release may foreign reserves data at some stage. the early focus in asia on thursday is in japan with the final q1 gdp revisions, while the latest trade data will also be released. over in europe on thursday we also receive the final q1 gdp revisions for the euro area, while industrial production in germany for april and trade data in france is also due. the big event in europe on thursday comes just after midday with the ecb meeting which will be closely followed by draghi’s press conference. the only release due in the us on thursday is initial jobless claims. china will also release may trade data at some stage on thursday. we end the week in asia on friday with the may cpi and ppi prints in china. over in europe we’ll get april trade data in germany, industrial production in france, and industrial production and trade data in the uk. we finish the week in the us with the final april wholesale inventories print. with the fed into the blackout period now there’s no fedspeak this week while over at the ecb, along with draghi’s press conference we’ll also hear from nowotny on friday. the big event this week is likely to be the uk election this thursday which will include exit polls just after polling stations close at 10pm bst. results will then be released through the night. also worth keeping an eye on is former fbi director james comey’s testimony before the senate on thursday. other things to note are the rba meeting on tuesday, rbi meeting on wednesday and oecd 2017 outlook on wednesday. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com

916,"Hedge Fund CIO: ""Normally The Fed Would End This Bubble, But It Can't This Time For One Reason""",2017-06-04 22:31:00+00:00,"in his latest weekend notes, one river asset management cio, eric peters, picks up where bofa's mike hartnett left off on friday when he said that the "" qe monster"" will only end when ""the wall street bubble"" finally shocks the fed . yes, but what will ""end it"", or better yet, what will ""shock"" yellen and company out of their complacency? to this, peters' response is that the fed finds itself in a big ""quandary"" not so much due to the s&p500, and overall asset levels, which even yellen now admits "" pose risks to financial stability "" as per the latest fomc minutes , but due to china: “the real credit excesses haven’t been created here, they’ve formed in china, which leaves the fed in a quandary.” much as the fed would like to have jurisdiction over every corner of global finance, they no longer control china. he's right: with rates on various chinese debt instruments surging in recent months, as beijing cracks down on shadow banking, any further tightening by the fed may or may not impact the momentum-chasers that have sent amazon above $1,000, but it will certainly have a dramatic impact on china's cost of funding, which in turn would unleash the next deflationary shockwave around the globe, sending global rates tumbling once again as the reflationary, rate hike frenzy fizzles, and forces the fed to promptly cut rates back to zero (if not negative). here is the quick and dirty from eric peters: quandary “classic late-cycle action,” said the cio. “vol-compression, loosening financial conditions, and a pain-trade that tilts forever higher,” he continued. “normally the fed ends it. hiking aggressively, flattening the curve, widening credit spreads, and then the economy rolls.” but this cycle is not quite like the others. “the real credit excesses haven’t been created here, they’ve formed in china, which leaves the fed in a quandary.” much as the fed would like to have jurisdiction over every corner of global finance, they no longer control china. “by closing the capital account, the chinese once again have complete dominion over their domestic credit machine,” continued the same cio. “when they were actively opening up the capital account, china relinquished control over their interest rates to the fed.” the volatility of jan/feb 2016 was one of many consequences; a lesson not soon forgotten. now that the chinese have retaken control, economic volatility is more likely to come from within. “ the warning sign for real problems will be a material decline in house price appreciation .” or, as we explained in march, "" why the fate of the world economy is in the hands of china's housing bubble "" tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China Volatility Housing Bubble Shadow Banking,1
997,May Payrolls Preview: The Tiebreaker,2017-06-02 10:18:00+00:00,"after a poor march jobs report, followed by an april scorcher, the may payrolls report due at 8:30am on friday will be the tiebreaker, not only for the current state of the economy where both soft and hard data have been deteriorating in recent weeks, but perhaps also for the june rate hike decision, which as the fed noted in its may fomc minutes, may not take place without ""evidence"" that the recent ""transitory weakness"" in the economy is over. here are the consensus expectations for tomorrow's report: payrolls expectation in terms of overall expectations, the consensus is looking for 185k nonfarm payrolls to be added to the us economy in may - the same as the april consensus - compared to 211k actual jobs added in april. that according to ransquawk would be in line with the 185k/month pace seen in 2017 thus far. on one hand, there is potential for upside surprise, as per today's stellar adp report which came in at 253k, far above the 185k expected. on the other, goldman believes a favorable swing in the weather between the march and april survey periods boosted last month's hiring pace, and suggests the 211k pace of april job growth ""likely overstates the near-term underlying trend"", as such there will be payback in the may report. also, goldman cautions that the adp measure has been running above official private payroll growth so far this year, by 60k per month on average, so take it with a grain of salt. unemployment rate the unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.40%, matching the lowest reading recorded since 2001, and beneath the fomc’s nairu projection between 4.70% and 5.00% (made in its march forecasts). a 4.4% print would be stronger than the fed’s own year end forecast of 4.50%. if may unemployment stays at or near that level, it would be further evidence the economy has reached full employment and is at full capacity, meaning virtually everyone seeking work has found a job, even if that doesn't explain why wage growth remains anemics. if the rate dips lower, that could put upward pressure on wages and inflation, or alternatively it will prompt questions about the quality of jobs added. earnings as a result, most of the attention is likely to fall on the earnings data for signs of inflationary pressures. average hourly earnings (ahe) are seen rising by 0.20% m/m, easing a touch from the +0.30% pace seen in april. on an annualised basis, the pace of ahe growth is seen rising by 0.10 ppts to 2.60%. in its latest beige book, the fed stated that “most firms across the districts noted little change to the recent trend of modest to moderate wage growth,” though many firms reported offering higher wages to attract workers “where shortages were most severe.”  according to ransquawk, hsbc notes that though wage growth has picked up, as of late, it remains sluggish when compared to previous cycles. looking at the may wage number in particular, goldman warns there may be a negative surprise pointing out that the may payroll period ended on the 13th, which is associated with meaningfully below-average wage growth . goldman's summary: we estimate nonfarm payrolls increased 170k in may, a moderate slowdown from april’s +211k pace and modestly below the three-month moving average of +174k. while labor market fundamentals remained broadly stable – featuring a further decline in continuing jobless claims – recent deterioration in service sector employment surveys suggests hiring may be slowing at the margin. we also believe a favorable swing in the weather between the march and april survey periods suggests the 211k pace of april job growth likely overstates the near-term underlying trend, which we believe is closer to 175k (and should slow further as the economy moves beyond full employment). relatedly, may is also an important hiring month, and labor supply constraints in some geographies and industries suggest some additional downside risk. on the positive side, both jobless claims and the adp report suggest more favorable labor market fundamentals, and the end of the federal hiring freeze suggests scope for above-trend growth in federal employment. on wages, goldman warns there may be disappointment: we estimate average hourly earnings increased 0.2% month over month and 2.5% year over year in may, reflecting the interaction of firming wage growth with negative calendar effects. the may payroll period ended on the 13th, which in our model is associated with meaningfully below-average wage growth . however, we are more constructive on wage growth generally, exemplified by the acceleration in the  employment cost index to a cycle-high pace in q1. factors arguing for a stronger report: arguing for a weaker report: neutral factors: * * * other observations: impact on fed policy: possible market reaction tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",2s10s 2s10s Dallas Fed Markit New York Fed Philly Fed Richmond Fed Unemployment Insurance Consumer Confidence Continuing Claims Beige Book BLS Unemployment 2s10s.

1124,"Quiet Month End Markets Hide ""Below The Surface"" Fireworks",2017-05-31 11:58:00+00:00,"it has been another quiet session for global equity markets, with s&p futures flat, as are european and asian stocks, which is perhaps odd, as there was quite a bit of newsflow and, in the case of china, outright fireworks. the main event in dm was the violent move in sterling, which as we first reported on tuesday afternoon , tumbled for the first time this week after a yougov poll showed theresa may’s conservative party may fall short of a majority. the currency’s weakness boosted british equities, and the ftse 100 index rose even as miners and energy companies weighed on the broader european gauge after another night of sliding commodities in china. ""the return of u.s. and uk markets yesterday (after holidays) saw a little bit of weakness creep in as we head into month end and what has been a positive month for markets, with records broken on an almost daily basis,"" said michael hewson, chief markets analyst at cmc markets. ""this soft tone looks set to be carried over this morning,"" he said. uncertainty about the reliability of polling, however, helped contain the pound’s retreat, which has since regained all of its overnight losses, but the moves are a reminder of the potential risks surrounding a series of national elections in europe this year. another key overnight event, one which helped the shanghai composite close higher, was a stronger than expected chinese mfg pmi, as well as a non-manufacturing pmi which rose in may. specifically, china’s nbs may manufacturing pmi came in at 51.2, same as the previous reading and slightly above expectations. the official non-manufacturing pmi (comprised of the service and construction sectors at roughly 80%/20% weights, based on our estimates) increased to 54.5 in may from 54.0 in april, on higher services pmi. services pmi rose to 53.5 from 52.6 in april. on the other hand, construction pmi fell to 60.4 from 61.6 in april. but china's ""goalseeked"" indices were far less notable than what happened in china’s currency market, where the offshore yuan jumped the most in four months as funding costs exploded amid speculation policy makers were supporting the currency in the wake of a surprise sovereign rating downgrade. at one point, in its ongoing crusade to crush offshore yuan shorts, the pboc sent the overnight interbank rate higher than 21%.... ... while the cnh overnight deposit rate hit a staggering 65%! as a result, the cnh premkum to cny rose as much as 2.3 standard deviations, as beijing appears set to send the yuan far higher, perhaps still hurting from the recent moody's downgrade, and intent on teaching shorts a very memorable lesson. as shown in the chart below, the yuan hit the strongest level against the dollar, with the offshore yuan surging the most. meanwhile, as the currency surged, china's commodities - perhaps predictably - tumbled, with all mainland commodities tumbling by the close of trading. all mainland commodities closed in green (down) today. coke leads -8.97%, rubber -7.81%, coking coal -7.64% pic.twitter.com/ctrcinyddx — simon ting (@simonting) may 31, 2017 elsewhere in asia, 10yr jgbs were lower amid a mild improvement of the risk tone in the region, while the curve was slightly flatter on outperformance in the super-long end, even after a bloomberg report that the boj may ""taper its taper"" and revert to its traditional bond purchase schedule . away from china, a much anticipated european inflation report showed that draghi still has room to scapegoat weak eurozone inflation, afterboth headline and core cpi missed expectation, printing at 1.4% y/y (exp. 1.5%) and core 0.9% y/y (exp. 1.0%) respectively. also today, representatives from the ecb, esm and the greek government will be in frankfurt today to discuss, among other things, the prospect of a return to the financial markets for greece. esm and greek officials recently claimed that greece should be able to return to the market by summer 2018. but given the current impasse between greece and her creditors, and the fact that a commitment on debt relief from the eu will probably be pushed back until the end of 2018, that seems optimistic according to capital economics. looking at other asset classes, oil extended losses even as industry data later is expected to show a supply drop in the u.s. even as the american drill count is at the highest since april 2015. what is most notable here is that opec jawboning now appears to have lost all potency, as oil tumbled even after the saudi energy minister vowed to do ""whatever it takes"" to cut inventories. oil has since tumbled to fresh session lows. falih has gone for ""whatever it takes"" ""committed to cutting inventories to 5y ave"" and ""joint commitment"" and #brent is 10c off session low — amanda cooper (@a_coops1) may 31, 2017 and yet, despite all this, markets barely batted an eyelid, and world stocks are poised to end may up nearly 2 percent, marking the seventh straight monthly increase and the longest monthly winning streak in over a decade. the msci's global equity index held steady on wednesday, while european stocks edged down 0.1% in early trade following wall street's dip on tuesday. the msci asia pacific index dropped 0.1 percent, paring its advance for may to 2.6%. some asian shares were boosted by the noted strong chinese pmi surveys, although a sturdy performance from the japanese yen helped push the nikkei into the red. european indexes were slightly higher early on wednesday, with the stoxx 600 up 0.2% to 381.31 . u.s. futures pointed to a rise of 0.1 percent on wall street. in rates, the yield on 10-year treasuries rose one basis point to 2.22 percent after declining four basis points in the previous session. benchmark yields in the u.k. were little changed after a drop of two basis points tuesday. economic data include mba mortgage applications, chicago pmi and pending home sales. analog devices and hp are among companies reporting earnings. global market snapshot top overnight stories from bloomberg asian markets shrugged off a negative lead from the us where the s&p 500 snapped a 7-day win streak, with the region mixed as china returned from holiday to be greeted by encouraging pmi data. this aided a recovery in the asx 200 (+0.1%) which was underpinned by it and financial sectors, while nikkei 225 (-0.1%) lagged after industrial production figures missed estimates. shanghai comp. (+0.2%) initially outperformed as mainland participants returned to market and digested better than expected official chinese manufacturing pmi as well as an improvement in non-manufacturing pmi data, although the support from the data gradually faded throughout the day. 10yr jgbs are lower amid a mild improvement of the risk tone in the region, while the curve was slightly flatter on outperformance in the super-long end. chinese official manufacturing pmi (may) 51.2 vs. exp. 51.0 (prey. 51.2). non-manufacturing pmi (may) 54.5 (prey. 54.0) top asian news in europe, price action and macro newsflow has been relatively quiet for most part of the european morning, stocks are modestly lower across the board with material and energy names the notable laggards. this comes despite some encouraging data from china, which reported mfg. pmi was unchanged at 51.2 against expectations of a fall to 51. notable outperformers this morning is ericsson after activist investor cevian capital bought a stake of over 5% in the co. tesco shares slipped in the wake of the latest kantar world panel data which showed discount retailers sales rising the most since 2015. in credit markets, oats are benefitting from the large month-end extension with the 10 and 30yr spread vs the bund  tighter by 1.5bps. elsewhere, bund yields have ticked up this morning, slight underperformance led by the long end. top european news in currencies, the pound was the key mover, initially tumbling, then recovering all losses and trading at 1.2850 latest. the euro was little changed, heading for a monthly gain of 2.6 percent, its best performance in more than a year. the yen was up 0.1 percent at 110.76 per dollar after rising 0.4 percent tuesday. the south african rand strengthened 0.1 percent after tumbling for two days. the bloomberg dollar spot index was little changed for a third straight day. the gauge is down 1.3 percent for the month.  most of the action — if we can call it that(!) — has been in gbp, where the yougov forecasts through their latest polls put a median probability that a tory win will fall short of attaining a majority. when the headlines first hit the wires, cable was trading in the mid 1.2800's, but hit down through 1.2800, a series of attempted recoveries continue to run into sellers as election fears dictate. added pressure seen through the month end demand seen in the eur/gbp rate, but this pair is struggling around 0.8750, above which lies the strong resistance zone from 0.8800-0.8860. cable support ahead of 1.2750 looks vulnerable though. elsewhere, usd/jpy is struggling again, and the repeated moves below 111.00 test the resolve of buyers lining up ahead of 110.00-50. us treasury yields are struggling, though no major sell off in sight as yet, but we have some key data to look to over thursday and friday, so the above support may hold in the interim. eu cpi was 0.1% off expectations at at 1.4%, but widely anticipated after the german release yesterday. the unemployment rate eased off to 9.4%, but the eur is modestly supported today on cross rate flow. in commodities, there is not too much activity across the commodity spectrum to look to as the global risk mood is pretty balanced at the present time. near term usd weakness is also adding little influence also, but after the china pmis overnight, which were a touch above expectations, we would have expected to see some stabilisation in the metals complex. copper is back in the middle of the usd2.50-2.60 range, but remains heavy amid losses elsewhere. after outperforming yesterday, nickel is down over 2.5% today, losing the 9000 level (since june last year (with zinc not far behind at a little under 2.0% down on the day. oil prices have been drifting sideways, but with wti struggling to stay close to usd50.00. this has been exacerbated by a rise in libyan production levels, which has pulled light texas under usd49.00 recently. brent steady in the mid usd51.00's, but dragged lower. nb, apis are tonight. silver remains comfortably above the usd17.00 level, while gold is struggling for upside despite the weakness in the greenback. looking at today’s calendar, we’ll get the may chicago pmi which is expected to nudge down a little to 57.0, and also april pending home sales. the fed’s beige bok is also due to be released today while the fed’s kaplan speaks at 8am bst. us event claendar db;s jim reid concludes the overnight wrap welcome to the last day of may, the month not the uk pm ahead of next week's election. on the subject of uk politics i had the surreal experience of being in a hotel room in berlin last night wifi-ing into my tv at home and seeing the leader of the opposition jeremy corbyn presenting a pot of homemade jam to the interviewer on the show he was on. he also boasted about his love of his allotment. before i get too critical my recent attempt at making homemade hummus was a disaster and i should add that in a small herb garden we have outside our kitchen, this year's basil has just died over the weekend in spite of much attempted love and affection. the herb garden cost us a fortune to install and was meant to be a lasting monument to our wedding and one that would provide us with many good harvests over the years ahead and remind us of our happy day. so far we've got the equivalent of about 5 pots of herbs out of it in nearly 4 years. they would have cost us about 5 pounds in the supermarket. like my basil, markets are wilting slightly at the moment. there's nothing sinister around but it does feel like there is a slight loss of confidence as data momentum is stalling a touch and politics continues to be unpredictable. staying in the uk there's been a bit of a shock poll overnight from yougov/ times that shows that the conservative party could lose 20 seats in next week’s election and with it the party’s current slim majority. the poll showed that the conservative party is on track to take 310 seats (versus 330 seats currently) with 326 seats needed for a majority while labour may win 257 seats, up from 229. that central estimate therefore implies a hung parliament. the poll is yougov’s first constituency-by-constituency estimate however it appears that the model allows for big variations and a large margin of error with it also suggesting that the conservatives could take home as many as 345 seats and as few as 274. the model supposedly draws upon 50,000 respondents quizzed over the course of a week. notwithstanding the complexity of the polling methodology and some of the large variations, the headlines saw sterling immediately tumble around -0.50% and down to as low as $1.279, although it has bounced back a bit since and currently sits at -0.35%. on this subject yesterday db’s mark wall and oliver harvey published a note addressing some of the recent trends in the polls. their central case is still for a market-friendly 50/60 seat conservative majority, albeit just. in their note they look at four alternatives in the case of a less-than-50-seat majority outcome, none of which are market friendly. indeed they go on to say that there is value in owning downside to gbp/usd with risk premia and outright vol way below other uk political event risks such as the may 2015 election, brexit and scottish independence referendum. staying with politics, with markets coming to terms with a possible italian election as soon as this autumn and president trump taking to twitter yesterday to criticise germanyfor not spending enough on nato and the military, markets were on the back foot in europe from the off with the stoxx 600 closing -0.19%. the us session was probably best remembered for amazon’s share price briefly passing $1,000 for the first time ever as the broader market was fairly dull with the s&p 500 (-0.12%) bringing to an end a run of 7 consecutive daily gains. some mixed macro data and softish inflation reports on both sides of the pond (more on that shortly) didn’t help. on that the us economic surprise index continues to hover near 12-month lows while the global measure is at the lowest in over 6 months now. adding to the softness was the steady slide for oil prices which saw wti touch as low as $49.03/bbl intraday and down nearly a dollar from friday. meanwhile most dm bond markets (apart from germany for good reasons and italy for less good reasons) are approaching the tight end of their 3 month yield range. the data combined with some cautious words from the fed’s brainard yesterday saw 10y treasury yields fall 3.7bps to 2.211% which compares to the 3 month range of 2.168%-2.626%. gilts were nearly 2bps lower yesterday at 0.992% which is the low mark of the last 3 months with the high being 1.251%. oat yields were 0.5bps lower at 0.725% which is also the bottom of the range (the high being 1.114%). it’s a similar story too in spain, portugal, sweden, switzerland and the netherlands. meanwhile china’s official may pmis were released just a few hours ago and the data is largely positive. the manufacturing reading was unchanged during the month at 51.2 however that did compare to expectations for a small decline to 51.0. the new orders component also held steady at 52.3 while the nonmanufacturing reading rose a solid 0.5pts to 54.5. following a two-day break, chinese bourses were initially higher following that data however have pared a good chunk of the move with the shanghai comp now just +0.07%. in fact momentum has faded across much of asia with most bourses now flat to very modestly in the red, following a large positive start this morning. back to yesterday. just on those brainard comments, while the fed official highlighted that she still expected a fed rate hike soon she also noted that “i see some tension between signs that the economy is in the neighbourhood of full employment and indications that the tentative progress we had seen on inflation may be slowing”. she added “if the soft inflation data persist, that would be concerning and, ultimately, could lead me to reassess the appropriate path of policy”. it’s worth noting that while brainard had typically been more upbeat of late, she is also well known for being one of the more dovish members on the fomc. over at the ecb there was a bit of interest in a reuters report which suggested that ecb officials are ready to drop the reference to downside risks in their statement at the meeting on june 8th and instead replace it with “largely balanced”. the article also suggested that the ecb will debate the removal of its easing bias. none of this appeared to be a great surprise though and the euro was quick to pare back a small jump. speaking of fx, yesterday our global fx strategists published their latest fx blueprint. the most notable takeaway for us is their eur/usd view which they expect to hold at the top end of the 1.05-1.15 range given european data surprises at positive extremes versus the us, a soft ecb tapering already appearing priced in, european equity valuations shifting to being expensive versus the us and unhedged equity inflows approaching previous peaks. on the us side the path of monetary policy looks mis-priced in their view while the euro has already overshot relative to short-term rate differentials. they expect the euro to gravitate back to 1.10 over the summer. a link to their report can be found here. finally to the economic data now where yesterday the main focus was on the various inflation reports. in germany headline cpi in may was revealed as falling a little more than expected (-0.2% mom vs. -0.1% expected) with the annual rate dipping six-tenths to +1.4% yoy as a result. in spain a flat headline cpi reading for may saw the annual rate also fall six-tenths to +2.0% yoy which was a tenth lower than  expected. it’s worth noting that these readings come ahead of the euro area cpi report today. over in the us we learned that both personal income and spending rose +0.4% mom in april, as expected with the latter seeing the march reading also revised up three-tenths. the headline pce deflator rose +0.2% mom lowering the annual rate by two tenths to +1.7% yoy. the more important core measure rose +0.2% mom also however base effects saw the annual rate fall one-tenth to +1.5% yoy and the lowest reading since december 2015. away from the inflation readings, in france q1 gdp was revised up one-tenth to 0.4% qoq while the european commission’s economic indicators for may showed a 0.5pt decline in the economic sentiment index to 109.2 in may, albeit still the second best reading since 2007. in the us the headline consumer confidence reading dipped 1.5pts to 117.9 in may and is now down 7pts from the march high. a decline in the forward-looking expectations index appeared to be the driver, fallings 2.8pts to a four-month low of 102.6. elsewhere the dallas fed’s manufacturing survey for may saw a 0.4pt increase in the headline reading to 17.2, while finally the s&p/case-shiller house price index reported that house prices rose +0.9% mom in march. looking at today’s calendar, this morning in europe we start with germany where april retail sales data is due, before we then get the flash may cpi print in france and then back to germany with may unemployment data. the uk follows that with april money and credit aggregates data before we then get the flash may cpi print for the euro area where the market is expecting a decline in the headline to +1.5 yoy (from +1.9%) and core to +1.0% yoy (from +1.2%) as base effects associated with the easter holiday timing roll out. across the pond this afternoon we’ll get the may chicago pmi which is expected to nudge down a little to 57.0, and also april pending home sales. the fed’s beige bok is also due to be released today while the fed’s kaplan speaks at 1pm bst. over at the ecb we are due to hear from coeure this morning and lautenschlaeger

1224,Key Events In The Coming Busy Week: US Payrolls; Eurozone Inflation And Fed Speakers,2017-05-29 12:58:00+00:00,"focus in this holiday-shortened week will turn to us data, especially nfp, fed speakers and eurozone inflation. uk pmis will also draw attention as elections approach. we also get gdp data from canada, sweden and switzerland. in em, there are mp meetings in brazil & israel. on monday, with us, uk and chinese markets closed, euro fx and bond markets will be on mario draghi alert on monday as the ecb president speaks to the european parliament. nfp, fedspeak, eurozone inflation after the fomc minutes and a mixed finish to us data last week (q1 gdp revised higher though durables weighed on 2q gdp), attention turns squarely to upcoming us data this week, particularly friday's payrolls report. the u.s. jobs report friday should bolster the case for a rate hike, with a gain of 180,000 jobs expected. with a june hike 80% priced, any fed commentary will also be carefully parsed for clues that the fed is comfortable with this pricing. with the blackout period looming, the fed only has next week to push back against - or indeed affirm - market expectations if they so choose. after the fomc minutes, most banks have brought forward their base case for june & september fed hikes this year. the june ecb meeting is also fast approaching, and expectations are that we will see a change in language, signaling a hawkish shift. this week's eurozone inflation data will therefore draw increased attention. bofa economists expect inflation to drop to 1.4% in may, from 1.9% in april, with core also expected to move 20bp lower, to 1.0% in may. also in europe, euro-area data this week may show the strongest economic confidence in a decade on tuesday. the preliminary headline inflation rate for the region will come on wednesday. the eia is due to release its monthly supply reports wednesday. the week ahead in emerging markets there are monetary policy meetings in brazil and israel. brazil’s central-bank decision on wednesday will probably see a cut of 75 to 100 basis points from the current 11.25 percent, according to economists. china’s may manufacturing pmis on wednesday could indicate that the nation’s 2017 growth has already peaked. daily calendar, via db as noted before, with markets closed in both the uk (bank holiday) and us (memorial day) today it’s an unsurprisingly quiet start to the week with m3 money supply growth for the euro area in april the only data due. we kick off tuesday in japan where the april retail sales and employment data is due. in europe tomorrow we get q1 gdp in france, cpi in germany in may and confidence indicators for the euro area in may. over in the us tomorrow we’ll get personal income and spending for april along with the pce core and deflator readings, followed by the march s&p/case-shiller house price index reading, may consumer confidence reading and may dallas fed manufacturing activity index print. turning to wednesday, the overnight data in asia comes from china where the official may pmis are due. in japan we’ll get industrial production and housing starts. in europe on wednesday we get may cpi in france, germany unemployment in may, april money and credit aggregates in the uk and the may cpi report for the euro area. in the us on wednesday we’ll get the chicago pmi for may and april pending home sales print. thursday kicks off in japan again where q1 capex data will be released along with the final manufacturing pmi revision. manufacturing pmis dominate the european session on thursday with final readings due in the euro area, germany and france along with a first look at the periphery and uk. in the us we’ll also get the manufacturing pmi along with q1 unit labour costs and nonfarm productivity, may adp report, initial jobless claims, may ism manufacturing and april construction spending. it’s a quiet end to the week in europe on friday with ppi for the euro area in april the only data due. in the us it’s all eyes on the may employment report, while we’ll also get the april trade balance print. away from the data we’re light on fedspeak this week with williams (today), brainard (tuesday), kaplan (wednesday) and williams and powell (thursday) the only scheduled speakers. over at the ecb we’ll hear from nowotny and draghi (today), liikanen (tuesday) and villeroy (thursday). the boj’s harada also speaks on thursday. other things to note this week are uk pm may’s televised q&a tonight with opposition leader jeremy corbyn and the china-eu summit beginning on tuesday in brussels. below is a visual summary of the week's key events: * * * finally, looking only as the us, the key economic releases this week are the ism manufacturing report on thursday, the employment report on friday and pce inflation and consumer confidence on tuesday and trade on friday. in addition, there are several scheduled speaking engagements by fed officials this week. the beige book for the june fomc period will be released on wednesday. more from goldman monday, may 29 tuesday, may 30 wednesday, may 31 thursday, june 1 friday, june 2 source: goldman, bofa, db tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China San Francisco Fed Dallas Fed Germany Housing Starts Initial Jobless Claims Japan Markit New York City Federal Reserve Trade Deficit Personal Income Switzerland Philly Fed Trade Balance Monetary Policy Richmond Fed Consumer Confidence Bond Conference Board Money Supply Continuing Claims Chicago PMI Case-Shiller Brazil CPI Beige Book Unemployment Israel M3 John Williams Eurozone France,1
1308,Fed Plan Falters As Euro Inflation 'Surprise' Sparks Bund Fears,2017-05-26 20:22:00+00:00,"as socgen's kit juckes noted earlier in the week, ""the ecb, not the fed, is in the driving seat,"" and nowhere is that more optically obvious than in the massive divergence between us-eu bond risk premia and us-eu inflation surprises . the fomc’s intent to raise rates in june is clear and reflected in market pricing. but the commitment to any particular forecast of where rates are heading is less clear and seems secondary to a desire to hit the 2% inflation target. with president trump’s program stalled, the dollar is lacking domestic policy drivers and fx markets are more susceptible to policy elsewhere. this is good for the euro, and possibly for oil-sensitive currencies, and is carry friendly (yen negative) too. furthermore, as reuters noted, recent u.s. inflation readings have returned to their long-term trend of underperforming against forecasts after a brief run of upside surprises earlier this year. meanwhile, inflation reports from europe have topped expectations by the widest margin on record. the rest of the so-called group of 10 largest developed economies are meanwhile beating forecasts by the most since the financial crisis nearly a decade ago, even after taking into account the drag from u.s. numbers. even japan, notorious for its decades-long struggles against deflation, is posting inflation data notably above forecasts. the inflation ""surprise"" gap between the united states and europe has never been wider... and, as the chart above suggests, that is bad news for the ecb as they appear to be all that stands between a collapse in the german bund market and today's 'nirvana. as socgen notes, there’s a sense that while the fed is committed to raising rates next month, it is more committed to hitting its inflation target than to any particularly ‘terminal’ fed funds forecast. absent progress on meaningful tax cuts or upside surprises in either growth or inflation, the outlook is calm, or dull, depending on your point of view. that’s not particularly bad for the dollar, but rather it means that the big fx drivers are not as us-centric now. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Japan Reuters Yen SocGen Bond,1
1310,"RBC: ""Something Is Wrong Here: Indicators Are Flashing An Imminent Yield Breakdown Warning""",2017-05-26 19:40:00+00:00,"while stocks continue rising to all time highs on the back of a handful of tech stocks, the tension below the bond market grow, only not in the direction that an all time high in the s&p would suggest. as rbc macro strategist mark orsley writes in a friday note, ""i am finding it increasingly difficult to see a near term catalyst for ust’s to sell off. in fact, almost all indicators i watch are flashing a warning that a breakdown in yields (longer end) is increasingly probable "" and urges readers to ""position/protect for a move to 2.00%."" orsley lays out 4 reasons why any new bond shorts may soon be forced to cover, again. 1. technicals -> two head and shoulder formations point to lower yields.  target of 2.05% on the feb/march formation, and if 2.17% gives way, the h&s from april/may targets 1.95%.  notice the macd starting to trend lower… 2.  reflation -> the dollar (blue) is indicating the “reflation” trade is over and signaling a coming correction in 10yrs (black) to sub 2%... 3. correlations -> ust brethren’s are breaking down: aussie 10yr rates (blue) have broken down.  correlation points to 2% ust 10yrs… gilts (blue) motioning the same… 4. econonic data disappointing -> bloomberg surprise index (blue) points to 2%... on an anecdotal basis, equities have completely erased last week’s brief meltdown and have actually broken to new highs.  yet rates have not recovered the same way. something is wrong here and in conversations with clients, the concern is the fed is now talking down inflation prospects .  recall this blurb from the minutes as an example: “a few fed officials concerned progress on inflation goal slowed.”   additionally, participants are becoming increasingly worried of a policy error (tightening into a slowdown). that is a notable shift as we head into the june fomc meeting in a couple weeks.  it is worth noting with the ois market 80% priced for a hike that the last two hikes in this “cycle” has seen yields subsequently decline…. orsley's bottom line: "" it may seem like a no brainer to short at these levels into a fed hike (at least this time the market isn’t going in at the yield highs), but all the above indicators should serve as a warning to bond bears.  despite cleaner short positioning, the pain trade still remains lower yields.

1336,"Global Rally Fizzles After ""OPEC Shock"" In ""Slow Risk-Off Session""",2017-05-26 11:48:00+00:00,"s&p futures were fractionally lower from yesterday's record high as european stocks declined and asian stocks were mixed, pressured by yesterday's 5% plunge in crude after opec unexpectedly ""failed to surprise"" markets, and announced the bare minimum supply cut extension that was expected by oil traders, who in turn puked long positions. it wasn't just oil: it has been a slow risk-off session as bloomberg phrased it, ahead of the long weekend for u.s. and u.k. markets, with the key carry pair, usd/jpy breaking below 111.00 as the usd continues to weakens, while the gbp tumbled 0.5%, after the latest poll shows tory lead narrowing. as futures declined, fixed income markets ground higher as the 2s10s hits flattest level ytd. european equity markets open lower led by oil related stocks after yesterday’s heavy sell-off in oil. automakers also weaker after possible trump comments on german car exports. gold well supported amid general risk-off. most of the early attention, however, was on the market's reaction to yesterday's oil selloff. “to say that yesterday’s performance was disappointing for bulls is an understatement,” tamas varga, analyst at pvm oil associates wrote in an emailed report quoted by bloomberg. “it is, however, not a foregone conclusion that the trend is definitely turning. the question now is whether yesterday’s sharp drop in oil prices was a panic long-liquidation or the technical picture is now firmly turning bearish.” stocks from tokyo to europe were dragged down by oil producers as oil headed for a weekly loss after falling the most in three weeks on thursday as opec’s move to prolong supply cuts for nine months disappointed investors hoping for more. “markets ultimately found the renewed deal among opec and friends underwhelming, ” cole akeson, a strategist at sberbank cib in moscow, wrote in a note. “essentially, the market consensus seems to have come around to a view that regardless of what effect on global inventories the deal may have for now, opec and its partners have little insight as to what to do later on.” before this week’s deal, oil had climbed back above $51 a barrel after saudi arabia and non-opec member russia rallied support from the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other nations to extend the supply pact into 2018. however, as the chart below shows, that proved to be too optimstic for a market which no longer will buy simple on opec jawboning, but demands results. with oil in the spotlight, japan’s topix index slipped 0.6%, trimming its weekly advance to 0.6%. australia’s s&p/asx 200 index fell 0.7 percent, with bhp billiton ltd. dropping 2 percent.  south korea’s kospi rose 0.5 percent to another record. the index is up 2.9 percent for the week, the biggest gain in two months. hong kong’s hang seng index was flat, keeping its weekly gain at 1.8 percent, while the shanghai composite increased 0.1 percent. the stoxx europe 600 index dropped 0.4% with oil and gas producers falling 1.2%. s&p 500 futures were little changed, after rising 0.4% on thursday to new all time highs driven by a narrow basket of tech stocks. elsewhere, as discussed last night , the british pound tumbled over 0.5% to $1.2861 and looked set for its biggest one-day slide in over three weeks and steepest one-week decline since early april, after a poll showed the conservative party lead narrowed after the manchester attack, and as investors in asia sold the currency after u.k.’s first-quarter economic growth missed estimates. the poll results come less than two weeks before the june 8 general election. ""with this kind of momentum and almost two weeks to go until the vote, not only is this not going to be the breeze that may anticipated when she called the snap election last month , it could yet turn into a humiliating defeat for the conservative leader and her party,"" said craig erlam, senior market analyst at oanda.  ""coming on the back of losses yesterday, it's turning into a rotten end to the week for the pound."" elsewhere, confirming that the reason for the sharp spike in the yuan over the past two days, the biggest move since january, was direct government intervention, overnight bloomberg reported that china is considering changes to the way it calculates the yuan’s daily reference rate against the dollar ""to reduce exchange-rate volatility while undermining efforts to increase the role of market forces"" in asia’s largest economy. policy makers may add a “counter-cyclical factor” to the yuan’s daily fixing , according to a government statement on friday. analysts said the change would give authorities more control over the fixing and restrain the influence of market pricing. overnight, both the onshore and offshore yuan rose to three-month highs on continued speculation the chinese government will continue to support the currency and stock markets. the currency advanced for a second day on talk state-backed funds were propping up chinese assets thursday following moody’s downgrade of china’s credit rating. in currencies, the bloomberg dollar spot index fell 0.1 percent, poised for a second week of declines. the pound slid 0.5 percent to $1.2875 (see above). the yen rose 0.7 percent to 111.11 per dollar, after dropping 0.3 percent on thursday. the euro strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.1227 after its sharp drop on thursday, oil edged higher in early trading but remained on the back foot after tumbling 5% in the previous session. on thursday in vienna, the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec) and some non-opec producers agreed to extend a pledge to cut around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of the first quarter of 2018 - disappointing investors betting on longer or larger curbs. friday economic data include annualized gdp, durable goods orders and university of michigan indexes. bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot top overnight news asia equity markets traded mixed as the region failed to take the baton from another record setting day on wall st, with oil names dampened following the weakness across the energy complex. this saw commodity-related sectors in asx 200 (-0.7%) underperform as they felt the brunt of the 5% declines in crude prices due to disappointment from the opec output extension deal. a firmer jpy kept the nikkei 225 (-0.3%) subdued, while hang seng (unch.) and shanghai comp. (+0.2%) traded choppy amid a reserved liquidity operation by the pboc and continued pessimistic comments from moody's following the recent sovereign rating downgrade. 10yr jgbs traded higher amid a downbeat risk tone, while the boj were also present in the market under its bond buying operation for jpy 750b1n of jgbs in the belly to super-long end. moody's stated that china growth will slow, while it added that china may lose al rating if there are signs debt keeps increasing and debt surpasses expectations. top asian news european equities trade with modest losses , largely stemming from the disappointed/scepticism amongst investors over opec's decision to only extend the current output cut by 9-months. following this announcement crude prices slipped, wti hitting a low of usd 48.21, subsequently large energy names felt the brunt of this. although, crude prices have seen a modest reprieve this morning with wti consolidating above usd 49. across credit markets, egb's have been kept afloat with support from ftq flow, upside in bunds has met resistance at the 161.55 area, a breach may see a move to the 18th may highs situated at 162.02. as we approach month-end, citi expect healthy extensions for european and uk bonds, with oats set to benefit the most. top european news in currencies, gbp has been pressured with market attention being placed on the most recent polls which have shown a narrowing lead for pm may and her conservative party over the labour party. as such, gbp has tripped below 1.2900 to eye up support layered in around 1.2850-1.2844, a break through this could see a test to the may 4th low at 1.2831. usd-index continued to ease as one of the more dovish fomc speakers, bullard sounded the alarm over the path of inflation, most of this seen against the jpy, which has run through support at 111.50. elsewhere, the slip in commodities pressures aud yet again, this continues to drive aud/nzd lower which is now hovering around 3-month lows, given that nzd has remained firm in the wake of new zealand's strong budget position. in commodities, wti and brent crude futures have staged a modest recovery from yesterday's lows to enter the north american crossover modestly higher with the usual value-buyers entering the market amid no new developments on the fundamental side since yesterday's opec-inspired sell-off. in terms of newsflow for the complex, things have remained relatively light as markets take a breather from yesterday. in metals markets, gold has seen mild support with the safe-haven asset underpinned amid a cautious risk tone, which also kept copper subdued. looking at the day ahead now, the focus will be on the us this afternoon where there are a number of important releases due. first up is the second estimate of q1 gdp where the consensus is for an upward revision in growth to +0.9% qoq from +0.7%.  our us colleagues expect a small upward revision to +0.8% qoq. importantly for growth in the current quarter we’ll also receive the april durable and capital goods orders report where the consensus is for a weak headline durable goods  orders print to be offset by a healthy gain in both ex-transportation orders (+0.4% mom expected) and core capex orders (+0.5% mom expected). also due out  this afternoon is the final may university of michigan consumer sentiment print where it’s worth keeping an eye on the various inflation expectations indicators too. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap with markets already with one eye on the long weekend holidays in the us and uk it’s not been the most inspiring last 24 hours. really it has been all about oil after prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of opec and non-opec producers agreeing to extend the production cut deal by 9 months into 2018. that was pretty much as guided to although the disappointment reflected in the price action appeared to be twofold with cuts not being deepened and no new producers joining the pact. it did however appear that there was some optionality left open for cuts being extended beyond the additional 9 months should prices decline. it was also noted that the importance of the five-year rolling average of oecd inventory was cemented and our commodity strategists highlight that this helps solidify their expectations that output controls will eventually be extended at least until the end of 2018, and more likely than not into 2019 (you can find more details in their report here https://goo.gl/ae1ehm ). after touching a high of $52.00/bbl yesterday morning, post the headlines wti proceeded to tumble and finished the day down -4.79% at $48.90/bbl and back to the lowest level in a week. it was also the third biggest daily decline this year. this morning it is down another -0.90% too. the biggest impact on other asset classes yesterday was oil-sensitive currencies with the likes of the russian ruble (-0.90%), norwegian krone (-0.79%) and canadian dollar (-0.57%) all weaker. that was really the extent of the excitement in markets though. given the holidays in europe volumes were thin and price action was pretty benign as a result (stoxx 600 ending -0.06%). meanwhile it was business as usual for us equity markets again where – despite the energy sector doing its best to weigh on broader indices – the s&p 500 (+0.44%) rose for the sixth consecutive session and in doing so notched up yet another record high. the longest consecutive winning streak for the s&p this year came in february when it rose for seven sessions on the trot. some better than expected results in the retail sector, namely from best buy and pvh, appeared to be the driving force yesterday while the vix also finished the day lower and closed below 10.00 (at 9.99) for the first time in over 2 weeks. in fact it’s now closed below that level 3 times this year, including yesterday. from 1990-2016, it had actually only closed below 10 on a total of 9 occasions. there was a similar lack of excitement in treasuries yesterday where yields finished the day little changed after spending much of the session in a tight range. we did hear from the fed and specifically from governor lael brainard who said that she is encouraged by a brightening global economic outlook and that downside risks from certain economies appear to be fading. brainard has previously been one of the most dovish fed officials for what it’s worth. while we’re on the fed, it’s worth highlighting that yesterday our us economists made some small timing changes to their fed call for the rest of the year in light of wednesday’s fomc minutes. they note that if the fed intends to begin reducing its holdings of treasury and mbs securities this year, then policymakers are likely to announce a change in their reinvestment policy at the conclusion of the september 20 fomc meeting. the details of this policy should be made known well in advance – most likely after the june meeting (press conference and/or minutes). the team go on to say that given the committee’s concerns about a subsequent over-tightening of financial conditions once the process of reinvestment tapering begins, it is unlikely that the fed will raise the fed funds rate at the same time that they announce a change in reinvestment policy. as a result the team has now shifted their view of a june and september hike to a june and december hike, with the fed staying put at the september meeting. elsewhere, president trump’s overseas tour continues with trump yesterday causing some ripples at the nato summit after criticising allies for “chronic underfunding”. meanwhile the travel ban is back in focus overnight after the us attorney general said that the white house will appeal its latest courtroom defeat in the us supreme court. also worth pointing out is the washington post reporting that investigators are now focusing on trump’s son-in-law and advisor jared kushner in connection with the russia-election investigation. kushner was said to have held meetings with russia in december, however it remains to be seen if this is the person of interest that was mentioned in press reports (like washington post) last week. in asia this morning it’s been a much more mixed start for major bourses. while the nikkei (-0.35%), and asx (-0.65%) are down, mostly as a result of weakness in the energy sector, the shanghai comp and hang seng are flat and the kospi (+0.48%) has edged higher. us equity futures are also little changed. meanwhile the big mover in fx this morning is sterling which is down -0.42% versus the dollar after a yougov poll for the times (conducted over 24-25 may) showed the conservatives as holding just a 5% lead over labour at 43% to 38%. that is the smallest lead for the tories since may became pm back in july  last year. the last yougov poll (18-19 may) showed the conservatives as holding a 9% lead at 44% to 35%. other opinion polls showed a lead for the tories of as much 12-13% just over a week ago, so it’s worth keeping an eye on this trend over the next week or two. the other news to highlight from overnight is the pboc announcing that it is planning a change in the formula behind the daily yuan fixing to include a ‘counter-cyclical adjustment factor’. the suggestion is that it’ll dampen the impact of big swings. there has been little change in either the onshore or offshore yuan following that news. finally inflation data in japan this morning didn’t throw up any real surprises with headline (+0.4% yoy), core (+0.3% yoy) and core-core (+0.0% yoy) rates all up slightly versus march and more or less matching expectations. in terms of yesterday’s economic data, in the us the advance goods trade balance reading in april revealed a slightly wider than expected deficit of $67.6bn. away from that initial jobless claims continue to hover at multi-decade lows after printing at 234k for last week. the four-week average is now at 235k. meanwhile the kansas city fed’s manufacturing activity index for may edged up 1pt to +8 (vs. +9 expected) with the details showing that both new orders and employment were a little firmer which is in contrast to the data we saw in the richmond fed’s survey. the other data was the april wholesale inventories print which came in at -0.3% mom and will likely result in downward pressure on some of the gdp trackers. in europe the only data came from the uk where q1 gdp was revised down to +0.2% qoq from +0.3% with the big negative contribution coming from net trade. looking at the day ahead now, with no data of significance due out in europe this morning the focus will be on the us this afternoon where there are a number of important releases due. first up is the second estimate of q1 gdp where the consensus is for an upward revision in growth to +0.9% qoq from +0.7%.  our us colleagues expect a small upward revision to +0.8% qoq. importantly for growth in the current quarter we’ll also receive the april durable and capital goods orders report where the consensus is for a weak headline durable goods  orders print to be offset by a healthy gain in both ex-transportation orders (+0.4% mom expected) and core capex orders (+0.5% mom expected). also due out  this afternoon is the final may university of michigan consumer sentiment print where it’s worth keeping an eye on the various inflation expectations indicators too. away from the data there isn’t much central bank speak to highlight but it’s worth keeping an eye on the g7 summit where trump, may, macron and merkel are gathering. that meeting concludes on saturday with closing press conferences due to take place so we’ll have a recap in monday’s emr of any important snippets. fingers crossed we’ll also be opening monday  on the back of an fa cup final win for arsenal tomorrow. we need one positive to come away from what has otherwise been a fairly depressing season for arsenal fans. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general:

1353,"David Rosenberg: ""We Probably Will Have A Recession Next Year""",2017-05-26 02:44:00+00:00,"while every investor wishes they had a crystal ball, there’s one thing, says david rosenberg chief economist at gluskin sheff, that has predicted imminent recessions without fail. speaking at the strategic investment conference in orlando, florida, rosenberg pointed out that since 1950, there have been 13 cycles where the federal reserve tightened interest rates… and 10 of them ended in recession. this is also something which bofa's michael hartnett pointed out in early march, laying it out concisely on the following chart. so should we be prepared for another us recession in the near future? that's the question jonathan roth asked rosenberg in the enclosed interview. “i think what people should be focused on is the shape of the yield curve,” rosenberg said. “[every] single inversion of the yield curve, where short-term rates go above long-term interest rates, has presaged a recession—every single time.” the three times where rate hikes did not lead to recessions, he noted, were due to the fed stopping short of inverting the yield curve. at the moment, rosenberg suggested, “ the yield curve is flat enough that if the fed raises rates four more times, that’s all it takes. we probably will have a recession next year .” looking at the dot plots shows that more than 50% of all fomc officials are ready to raise rates four more times going into 2018, so “the risk isn’t necessarily high right now, but it is rising.” asked about the possible economic implications of the ongoing problems the trump administration faces, rosenberg shrugged off the question. “here’s what i’m going to forecast with 100% guarantee: that no matter what happens with donald trump, the united states will still have a president.” he said that the comey affair caused all of a one-day plunge in the stock market, “so politics, to me, unless it has a substantive impact on the earnings outlook or the economy, is just short-term noise.” what’s much more important, rosenberg said, is the supply side of the economy, an aspect that no one pays enough attention to. “what’s happening in terms of artificial, robotic intelligence and the shared economy… right now, we’re going through the fourth industrial revolution, and it’s having a profound impact on worker anxiety.” corporate tax reform is necessary, he conceded, but there are other constraints we have to deal with. for example: “ how is it that we have 23 million americans between 25 and 54 , in their prime working age, that are out of the labor force?” he surmised that “there’s some real structural things happening here that really transcend the need to cut taxes or what’s happening in terms of immigration policy.” so what are the implications for investors? there’s no doubt we are late cycle, rosenberg said. “that means you really want to tuck it in.” for his thoughts on what a late-cycle portfolio should look like and more, watch the full interview below. courtesy of mauldin economics tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",David Rosenberg Donald Trump Federal Reserve Yield Curve Fail Florida Gluskin Sheff Recession Rosenberg,1

1382,Fed Trial Balloon: JPM Warns Fed May Start Shrinking Balance Sheet In September,2017-05-25 16:52:00+00:00,"it appears the fed's balance sheet ""trial balloons"" using primary dealers as intermediaries have begun. after yesterday's unexpectedly explicit guidance on the future of the fed's balance sheet, which prompted goldman, citi, and various other banks to suggest they may bring forward their estimates for when the fed will announce the start of ""renormalization"", moments ago jpm's michael feroli, traditionally the analysts ""closest"" to the fed, did just that when he issued a report stating that that there is now "" chance of a september start"" to renormalization, with the values for monthly roll-off caps and phase-in period to be ""revealed at the june fomc meeting."" according to feroli, jpm continues to look for normalization to commence at the december fomc meeting but "" there is some chance of a september start , though this would not have a material difference for our projections on a multi-year horizon. at the meeting at which normalization starts we expect the committee to announce a set of monthly roll-off caps for the following year, which increase regularly every three months. "" our best guess is that the initial caps are $4 billion a month for mbs and $8 billion a month for us treasuries. in the preannounced schedule, these caps would be augmented each quarter by $4 billion and $8 billion, respectively, until at the end of the year they are $16 billion and $32 billion. consistent with yesterday’s minutes, even after the normalization process is fully phased in the monthly caps will still be in place, though in most months after the full phase-in they would cease to bind."" and here are the finer details which the fed may or may not have leaked to select banks, in an attempt to prepare for what is coming, and talking down the equity bubble: the committee has yet to communicate values for the monthly caps or the length of the phase-in period. presumably they will do this in the minutes to the june fomc meeting. it is less clear that the committee will have decided on a monetary policy implementation framework by the time roll-off begins (i.e. the current ratesetting system vs reverting to the pre-2008 system) and hence whether they will have decided on an ultimate amount of excess reserves available when the balance sheet is fully normalized. we have assumed a $500 billion target for excess reserves in our projections below. the other key assumption on the liability side of the fed’s balance sheet is currency growth, which we have penciled in at 4% per year . under these assumptions the balance sheet is fully normalized in late 2021 at a level close to $3.0 trillion, down from about $4.5 trillion now. after normalization the fed would turn to become a net buyer of  treasuries, at a pace of around $400 billion per year, partly to meet growing demand for currency and partly to replace mbs which will continue to roll off the balance sheet. during the normalization process we see the funds rate as the tool of first resort for adjusting policy to both economic strength and weakness, unless the funds rate returns to the effective lower bound around zero, at which point roll-offs would stop. this latter eventuality is a risk for normalization being completed later than we anticipate. mechanistic questions about the impact of this a quantitative tightening on asset prices aside (it will be very bearish as the market will realize soon), we remind reader what former fed governor kevin warsh said about the fed's normalization ""policy"" several weeks ago . i am confused by the fed’s ‘normalization’ strategy in monetary policy. its preferred sequencing of rate increases and balance sheet reductions differ markedly from what was agreed when we conceived qe in the ’war room’ amid the crisis. there might be good reason. but, the transmission mechanisms of rate changes and balance sheet adjustments are markedly different than projected. so too are the distributional effects. this merits a more robust public explanation. alas, a public explanation will not be provided. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Monetary Policy Excess Reserves Fed Governor Kevin Warsh Warsh,1
1391,"RBC Explains What The Hell Is Going On: ""Prudent"" Fed & Chinese Intervention",2017-05-25 14:47:00+00:00,"a ""prudent"" fed (and china's ""national team"" ) have spurred a risk-on rally, as rbc's head of cross-asset strategy charlie mcelligott notes the market's 'pavolovian' response to fed's 'dovish hints' contained within the minutes - despite simultaneously staying ‘on message’ with hiking / tapering commentary - prompts a ""qe of old"" response : stocks and treasuries bid, while the usd faded. china further perpetuates the ‘risk rally’ via apparent market interventions : 1.       intervention in fx markets to strengthen the yuan overnight, with speculation of a number of chinese banks selling dollars in the onshore market overnight which drove the yuan higher. 2.       chinese “national team” stock market inventions as well, with sharp-turns higher off of an initially weaker equities opening and again-weaker industrial metals.   major reversals off lows saw nearly all domestic markets close at highs (shanghai prop +2.8%), while hong kong’s hang seng closed at highs since july 2015, with chinese real estate developers leading. initial (and expected) ‘sell the news’ on the snoozer opec outcome, as they extend the output cut 9 months per expectations—which disappointed the ‘bullish surprise’ camp which anticipated more opec-‘gaming’ of the market, thinking it was possible for a deeper-cut in conjunction with the consensus extension. this move lower in crude is notable if it were to escalate the current rollover in ‘inflation expectations’ (10y be’s below 200dma) which continue to show as the largest price drivers of risk-assets and major rates markets currently per the qi factor pca model—although should be noted that both spx and hyg (us hy proxy) are both deeply out of regime with low r-squareds / low explanatory power. due to my much-discussed “chinese deleveraging / fed tightening / ecb pivoting ‘less dovish’” trifecta, we are seeing good buying in cash usts and receiving in swaps (strong 5y auction as well) keeping rates pinned despite the ongoing risk-asset rally. rates in-turn continue to dictate factor-behavior in equities -> inability for yields to move higher means ‘growth’ and ‘anti-beta’ continue to drive leadership, while ‘value’ is dead as a doornail until rates can move higher again. credit and multi-asset fund feedback: sitting with very high cash / look-alikes as they feel they aren’t being compensated to take on significant additional risk at such brutally-tight spreads here. positive spin is that they are constructive but wanting a selloff to deploy this cash, meaning there is still ammo for a ‘buyers are higher / tighter’ chase.  note: ig desk seeing net client selling in secondary this week (big notional) to fund the calendar as issuance train ‘rolls on.’ fed dovish-hawkishness: the fed has once again managed to ‘thread the needle’ as it pertains to the market perception of the minutes release yesterday.  despite maintaining messaging showing that the june meeting is ‘on track’ for the next hike, in conjunction with voicing confidence on back-half balance-sheet tapering–both in line with consensus—the fomc too was able to communicate a ‘still cautious’ bias simultaneously, regarding the obvious flattening trajectory of the recent growth story. essentially, the minutes read to many as if there was actually heightened debate surrounding rate increases. ""members generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowing in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation."" similarly, there was debate on still-soft pce price inflation forcing a “gradual approach to tightening,” as some recent communications could be viewed as too hawkish, which in turn was contributing to softer long-term inflation expectations per business surveys (talk about ‘reflexivity’…geeeeeez guys): ""some participants noted that core pce price inflation had been running below the committee’s objective for overall inflation for the past eight years and that it was important to return inflation to 2 percent, or that the public’s longer-term inflation expectations may have fallen somewhat, and that a gradual approach to tightening could help return expectations and inflation to 2 percent. one participant cited results of a district survey of businesses indicating that more than one-third of respondents saw the federal reserve as more likely to accept inflation below its 2 percent objective than above; that participant interpreted the survey results as suggesting that the committee’s communications about the symmetry of its inflation objective had not completely taken hold, a concern also mentioned by a couple of other participants...."" specifically, the fed eased concerns surrounding the ‘one-two’ punch of hiking in conjunction with balance-sheet tapering efforts via implementation of a ‘cap’ that would be lifted every three months upon commencement of said bs run-off. so once again, the fed’s hawkish actions (‘on message’ with june hike and taper commencement for fall / q4) perversely created a dovish market response, with ‘real rates’ (5y tips yields as proxy) actually easing almost 6bps from prior the meetings release to overnight lows. as such, we saw a “qe of old” market-reaction: stocks and usts higher against lower usd. #havecake #eatittoo chinese interventions: fast forward then to the asian session, where the yuan surged the most in four months as chinese banks were speculated in the onshore market selling dollars.  shortly thereafter domestic equities markets experienced massive reversals higher as well—most notably in financials, where state-backed funds have previously been mandated with buying shares to support the market. what followed: the csi 300 ‘financials’ sub-index turning from -30bps on the open to closing +3.8%; the chinext (smallcap) index erased a decline of -1.8% to finish ‘up’ on the day; and the benchmark shanghai comp is now +3.0% off the wednesday ‘post moody’s downgrade’ lows.  solid effort, folks. csi 300 financials see a 5.6sd move overnight (relative to ytd returns): treasuries ‘strong like bull’: rates are again unable to move higher, with longs building in cash/ futs and receiving in swaps.  the larger theme has been the “chinese deleveraging / fed tightening / ecb pivoting ‘less dovish’” story, with the contribution of course from the much-discussed softer us data and now, a ‘less hawkish’ interpretation of yesterday’s fed minutes—especially as it relates to the ‘pace’ of tapering. add in the us consumer ‘papercuts’ mounting (azo, aap, low and tif earnings or soft comps all notable in recent days) and there ya go. equities factor performance continues to be entirely-based around inability of rates to move higher: repeat after me—barbell of long ‘growth’ / long ‘anti-beta’ continues to drive leadership, while ‘value’ remain almost completely at the mercy of rates, with ‘cyclicals’ (energy, financials, industrials, materials) currently stuck as four of the six worst s&p sectors quarter- and year-to-date. ‘ growth’ and ‘anti-beta’ leading again yesterday against lagging ‘value’ is representative of the ytd theme—because rates are stuck lower due to fading economic expectations: growth, quality, anti-beta / low volatility / defensives lead against value, small caps and cyclicals lagging. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China Federal Reserve Volatility Reflexivity Yuan Hong Kong Crude OPEC Real estate,1

(+0.9%) and hang seng (+0.6%) have also edged gains after the pboc continued to inject liquidity into the interbank market and amid reports that china is mulling allowing foreign investors access to the futures markets. finally, 10yr jgbs were indecisive with demand lacking amid positive risk appetite, while the 40yr auction also failed to spur demand with the b/c slightly lower than prior. fitch stated that china's finance and track record underpin its a+ rating, but added that the nation's imbalances pose risks to economic stability. top asian news european equities kicked the session off broadly higher (eurostoxx 50 +0.1%) in a continuation of the sentiment seen during us and asia-pac trade following last night's fomc minutes release. however, with volumes light across europe amid the ascension day holiday (not a market holiday for most of europe), the dax took a tumble amid no new newsflow. this has largely been attributed to mundane trading conditions with those on the continent in the market today also potentially sitting on the sidelines ahead of opec today. from a sector standpoint, energy names lag ahead of the cartel's announcement today with notable downside seen specifically in petrofac (-14%) after suspending their coo. in fixed income markets, prices were dealt a helping hand by the dip seen in equities with prices also supported initially by the fallout from yesterday's fomc minutes. more specifically the german 10yr june contract took out yesterday's highs at 161.13 with some also attributing the move to model buying and covering of shorts. in peripheral markets, yields are slightly softer with modest outperformance seen in btps with investors seemingly confident heading into today's exchange (announced yesterday). top european news in currencies, the usd kicked off the session in close-proximity to the levels seen following the fallout of the fed minutes with not too much else for traders to initially feed off. the main highlight on the data front came in the form of the second readings of uk gdp which printed softer than expected (q/q 0.2% vs. exp. 0.3%), subsequently adding some modest pressure to gbp/usd despite firmer than anticipated business investment. elsewhere, fx has been particularly rangebound with modest choppy price action seen following the budget release in which surplus forecasts for fy 16/17 were revised higher, although surplus estimates for the approaching years were reduced. in commodities, wti and brent crude futures initially traded in close proximity to yesterday's highs with the base-case set at a 9-month extension to existing cuts. when this was largely confirmed by various oil ministers as they entered the meeting wti and brent crude futures faced heavy selling pressure, largely algo driven before retracing the majority of the move. furthermore, the cartel have refrained from any deeper cuts (outside bet) and libya and nigeria are still free to produce without constraints. additionally, the uae minister said that the focus will be on output, not exports which is interesting given the cartel have been subject to criticism for doing little to control exports. elsewhere, gold traded sideways overnight to hold on to the gains seen following the fomc minutes release, while copper saw muted trade with prices flat for the entire asia-pac session. looking at the day ahead now, we’ll get the april advance goods trade balance, april wholesale inventories, may kansas city fed manufacturing activity index and last week’s initial jobless claims print. away from the data the fed’s brainard is scheduled to speak at 10am. the other big focus for markets is the aforementioned opec meeting. it’s worth noting also that president trump is due to meet with the eu’s tusk and juncker today in brussels while also taking part in the nato summit. that starts at 3pm bst. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap one thing that hasn't changed much after last night is the view of the fed after they released their minutes. the expectations of a june hike were probably reinforced by remarks that it would ""soon be appropriate"" to raise rates but markets saw the overall release as dovish (10yr yields rallied 3.0bps after the release) as the fed signalled that balance sheet reduction would involve a process of rolling caps on reinvestment which perhaps means a slower initial early pace. the suggestion is that the limits would initially be set at low levels and then raised every three months, over a set period of time, to their fully phased-in levels. the minutes confirmed that “nearly all policymakers expressed a favourable view of this approach”. the statement also added that “policymakers agreed that the committee’s policy normalization principles and plans should be augmented soon to provide additional details about the operational plan to reduce the federal reserve’s securities holdings over time”. it’s worth adding that prior  to the minutes the fed’s harker also said that the strategy for the balance sheet should be to “keep it simple and let the markets know what we’re doing”. as well as treasury yields slipping the us dollar (-0.12%) was also a touch weaker following the statement, likely for the same reason. while it feels like a rate hike next month is near to a done deal, pricing for next month was actually a little lower too, albeit at still relatively well priced-in levels. based on pricing of ois forwards the odds of a june hike finished at 75% versus 77% prior to the minutes. this method uses the effective rate and seems to be a more reliable and realistic pricing method compared to bloomberg’s calculator which still shows the odds at 100% (and unchanged over the last few days). meanwhile there  appears to be no stopping us equity markets at the moment. the s&p 500 finished +0.25% last night and back above 2,400 to a new record high close. it also came to within a whisker (0.01%) of hitting the all time intraday high seen back on may 16th. the dow (+0.36%) also had another decent day while the minutes appeared to be another vol-killer with the vix dropping over 6% to a near two-week low of 10.02. markets were quiet in europe prior to all this with the stoxx 600 (+0.09%) closing a touch higher. before we look at how markets are doing this morning, it’s noting that today is the ascension day holiday in europe. while it’s observed in several countries in this continent most major markets will still be open with just swiss and nordic markets due to remain closed, although expect volumes to be a bit thinner than usual. the main event today is the opec and non-opec producers meeting in vienna. the tentative schedule suggests a 2pm bst start but as always with these sorts of things it wouldn’t be a great surprise to see leaks and speculation throughout this morning. all the chatter is that we’ll get an extension on the production cut deal, likely for another 9 months based on comments from various energy ministers. our commodity strategists note that given the profusion of reassuring noises coming from oil ministers, there are apparently few points of potential friction. they highlight that while earlier reports variously indicated that either ""all producers are in agreement"" (saudi arabia) or that ""almost all"" countries are in agreement (iraq), iraq's public acceptance of a nine-month extension establishes this as the most likely outcome. a deepening of cuts, though, has more potential to provide an upside surprise as the idea had been dismissed earlier by oil ministers. the inclusion of smaller producing non-opec countries such as turkmenistan, egypt and the ivory coast in the deal would be a negligible boost, in our team’s view. oil is going into the meeting on a bit of a tear of late, no doubt fuelled by rising expectations of a positive outcome. wti is sitting at $51.82/bbl this morning (up +0.90%) which is about +13% from the april lows, although still below the ytd high of $54.45/bbl. refreshing our screens, despite a slightly soft start most major bourses are following the lead from wall street last night and edging higher. the nikkei (+0.54%), hang seng (+0.42%), kospi (+0.79%), shanghai comp (+0.39%) and asx (+0.11%) are all up with us equity futures. it’s worth adding that chinese equities made a decent u-turn yesterday post the sovereign downgrade to finish flat on the day and the move this morning suggests markets have already shrugged it off. it’s also worth noting that hong kong has since been downgraded by one notch by moody’s to aa1 post that china move. also worth highlighting, the congressional budget office in the us has found that the republicans legislation to overhaul the us healthcare system is estimated to result in an increase in the number of uninsured people by 23 million while also reducing the budget deficit by $119bn over 10 years. that is $32bn less than under the previous version of the legislation. moving on. as well as hearing from the fed yesterday there was also some focus on ecb president draghi’s speech in madrid, especially following coeure’s comments on tuesday. ultimately the tone from draghi appeared to confirm that sequencing would not change. the key passage of his speech was his mention that “there is no reason to deviate from the indications we have been consistently providing in the introductory statement to our press conferences”. he added that “asset purchases are inevitably more difficult to calibrate, more complex to implement, and more likely to produce side effects that other instruments, including moderately negative rates”. so this suggests a more close alignment between ecb officials that a taper will come first, followed by rate hikes later. wrapping up, yesterday’s economic data was largely a sideshow although in fairness it was all fairly second tier in nature. in the us we learned that existing home sales fell slightly more than expected in april (-2.3% mom vs. -1.1% expected) while the fhfa house price index edged up +0.6% mom in march. in europe the only data released came from germany where consumer confidence edged up to its highest level since 2001 at 10.4 (from 10.2). before we look at the day ahead, there was some noise around italy yesterday after the industry minister carlo calenda said that the country still has much work to do before it could hold an election, suggesting he would be opposed to an early vote this year. calenda said that italy has to “arrive at elections at the

very much remain an issue in italy with opinion polls tightly bunched (and within the margin of error). it’s also worth noting that the banking sector is still far from being fixed and one would imagine that the hope would be for recaps to happen before the election. looking at the day ahead now, in terms of data, this morning in europe the only real release of note is a second estimate of q1

ecb’s constancio is due to speak this evening. the other big focus for markets is the aforementioned opec meeting. it’s worth noting also that president trump is due to meet with the eu’s tusk and

1434,"Wall Street's Take On The Fed Minutes: June, Sept. In Play; BS Unwind May Come Sooner",2017-05-24 21:31:00+00:00,"while the dollar and tsy yields both dropped to session lows shortly after the fomc announcement hit as traders focused on the fed disclosure that fomc voters thought it prudent to await evidence an ""economic slowdown is transitory"" suggesting the committee still wanted to hike rates but was willing to wait for the certainty of data,  goldman's disagreed and according to a just released assessment by goldman's jan hatzius, the statement was more hawkish than perceived by the market. specifically, hatzius claims that the may fomc minutes mirrored the statement in ""downplaying the weak q1 gdp print and the soft march inflation data, and also noted that most participants judged that “it would soon be appropriate” for the fomc to hike again."" hatzius also pointed out what he highlighted earlier, namely that the minutes contained new information about the eventual process for phasing out reinvestment, which will likely occur by “preannouncing a schedule of gradually increasing caps to limit the amounts of securities that could run off in any given month.” as a result, goldman continues to see "" an 80% probability of a rate hike at the june meeting and expect this to be followed by another rate hike in september and the announcement of balance sheet normalization at the december meeting. however, we see the risks to the timing of the balance sheet announcement as skewed toward the september meeting. "" here are the key points from his note: main points: * * * elsewhere, citi economists issued a comparable note according to which the risk of a september balance sheet announcement has also been brought forward, relative to the baseline december expectation. ""the fact that operational details are closer to being specified shows that the fomc could be ready to announce tapering of its balance sheet earlier than previously expected. this increases the risk of a september announcement relative to our current view for an announcement in december"" said citi economist andrew hollenhorst. they also note that, like goldman's reading of the minutes, the fomc members see q1 weakness as transitory, and note that the statements on inflation. ""on transitory q1 growth weakness: “members generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowing in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation”. but also: “most participants judged that if economic information came in about in line with their expectations, it would soon be appropriate to take another step in removing some policy accommodation.” in our view, positive economic activity data since the meeting corroborate the view that q1 gdp weakness was transitory. this is consistent with our expectation that the fed will hike in june."" furthermore, citi focuses on the read through from the recent weak inflation print. it says: on (1), “ most participants ” viewed recent softer inflation data as primarily reflecting transitory factors with a “few” expressing concerns that progress on the inflation mandate had slowed. on (2), a “ few ” participants continued to anticipate a substantial undershooting of the unemployment rate, and “several” point to the possibility for the need of a more rapid removal of accommodation, for instance, if the unemployment rate fell appreciably further, or if wages increased faster than expected, or if stimulative fiscal policy were enacted. according to hollenhorst these statements, even read in the context that inflation softened further and the unemployment rate fell since the meeting, appear to imply that unemployment rate undershoot is not a major concern while recent inflation softness is generally viewed as transitory. bottom line, citi read the may minutes as neutral with the ""discussion around balance sheet reduction was the most interesting part with earlier-than-expected details of a general plan"" and reiterates the bank's call remains for hikes in june and september with balance sheet reduction announced in december, although it may come as soon as september. * * * finally, here is stone mccarthy: tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Jan Hatzius Fed Funds Target CPI Unemployment,1

1440,"FOMC Minutes Signal Rate-Hike ""Soon"", Economic Weakness Probably ""Transitory"" But Need ""Evidence""",2017-05-24 19:59:00+00:00,"having top-ticked us economic data with its march rate-hike, all eyes are on the may minutes to confirm the total lack of data-dependence now present at the fed. the main focus of the minutes was on the 'normalization' of the balance sheet (since june hike odds are at 100%), which was confirmed with details of the plan revealed. economic weakness in q1 was shrugged off as ""transitory"" - although with the provision that evidence is needed - and tightening as well as balance sheet rolloff is appropriate ""soon"", likely signaling that a june rate hike is on despite the recent economic slowdown. fed also warns of asset valuations. key minutes headlines: the minutes had something for everyone, starting with the "" dovish cop "", and the focus on the triple reiteration of ""weakness"" in the fomc minutes, and furthermore the warning that q1 gdp weakness was not due to seasonality: the staff judged that the weakness in first-quarter real gdp was probably not attributable to residual seasonality and that it instead reflected transitorily soft consumer expenditures and inventory investment. another risk factor: the fed expected pce inflation to pick up more the spring ""which would be more consistent with ongoing gains in employment."" it did not happen... importantly, pce  growth was expected to pick up to a stronger pace in the spring , which would be more consistent with ongoing gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth. the fed also wanted move evidence the slowdown is transitory: members generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowing in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation. however, we then quickly shift to the "" hawkish cop "" because ironically, just a few lines lower, the fes does blame the weather: it was noted that much of the recent slowing likely reflected transitory factors, such as low consumer spending for energy services induced by an unusually mild winter and a decline in motor vehicle sales  from an unsustainably high fourth-quarter pace. nevertheless, contacts expected that demand for motor vehicles would be well maintained. the outlook is also expected to improve: with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy, members agreed that the slowing in growth during the first quarter was likely to be transitory and continued to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further, and inflation would stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. sure, it could also be inducted by the collapse in demand for auto and credit card loans as the fed itself discovered just a few days after the may fomc meeting in its latest senior loan officer survey, and reported previously here.  yet despite the fed's growing concern about ""weakness"", its conclusion was that gradual tightening remains appropriate: although the data on aggregate spending and inflation received over the intermeeting period were, on balance, weaker than participants expected , they generally saw the outlook for the economy and inflation as little changed and judged that a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation remained appropriate. as for employment and inflation... consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand, the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside. the risks to the projection for inflation were judged to be roughly balanced . the downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as roughly  counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential . also notable is the fed's explicit warning that ""vulnerabilities have increased for asset valuation pressures."" this overall assessment reflected the staff’s judgment that leverage as well as vulnerabilities from maturity and liquidity transformation in the financial sector were low, that leverage in the nonfinancial sector was moderate, and that asset valuation pressures in some markets were notable. although these assessments were unchanged from january’s assessment, vulnerabilities appeared to have increased for asset valuation pressures, though not by enough to warrant raising the assessment of these vulnerabilities to elevated. * * * ""in addition, it was noted that real estate values were elevated in some sectors of the cre market, that a sharp decline in such valuations could pose risks to financial stability, and that potential reforms in the housing finance sector could have implications for such valuations."" so...  the prices are too high? the fed also touched on deregulation risks: ""with regard to financial stability, several participants emphasized that higher requirements for capital and liquidity in the banking system and other prudential standards had contributed to increased resilience in the financial system since the financial crisis. however, they expressed concerns that a possible easing of regulatory standards could increase risks to financial stability. "" and on the future balance sheet ""renormalization"" and runoff: ""under the proposed approach, the committee would announce a set of gradually increasing caps, or limits, on the dollar amounts of treasury and agency securities that would be allowed to run off each month, and only the amounts of securities repayments that exceeded the caps would be reinvested each month. as the caps increased, reinvestments would decline, and the monthly reductions in the federal reserve’s securities holdings would become larger. the caps would initially be set at low levels and then be raised every three months, over a set period of time, to their fully phased-in levels. the final values of the caps would then be maintained until the size of the balance sheet was normalized. *  *  * if the fed somehow makes believe that the data ""continues to support"" normalization, then their credibility just went negative... data-dependence? the fed is still calling for 2 more rate hikes, the market sees just 1.44 hikes... so what happens when the fed balance sheet normalization begins? june rate hike odds were 100% before the minutes (and 50% chance of anmother hike by december - 39.3% + 9.6%) full minutes below... tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",CRE headlines CRE Prudential Federal Reserve Personal Income Loan Officer Survey Monetary Policy Unemployment Market Conditions Real estate,1

1447,"The Key Things To Look For In Today's FOMC Minutes, And How To Trade Them",2017-05-24 17:56:00+00:00,"despite a near-collapse in the us economic surprise index - a key leading indicator, and major negative for the us economy... ... and recent disappointing inflation readings, largely attributed to the telecom sector in general and unlimited phone plan packages, not to mention the 0.7% q1 gdp print, today's fomc minutes scheduled (released at 2:00pm today with the usual 3 week lag) are likely to reveal a relatively optimistic fed with many committee members expecting the weakness early on in 2017 to prove ""transitory."" points of focus in the minutes will include future plans for the balance sheet (with reduction coming under increased scrutiny in recent times), after minutes of the march meeting showed that many of the policymakers thought a change in the fed's reinvestment policy would "" likely be appropriate later this year. "" as a reminder, fed officials left the interest rate unchanged within a range between 0.75% and 1% at their may 3 meeting, whose minutes could indicate whether they are preparing to lift it by a quarter percentage point at their next meeting june 13-14.  as such, traders and analysts will will be combing through the minutes to better understand the fed's current contraditory, and clearly non-data dependent assessment of the country's growth and inflation, as well as policymakers' forecast for activity going forward in the remaining seven months of the year. also according to stifel's lindsey piegza the market will also be looking for clues in the latest minutes as to the committees' likely handling of the $4.5t balance sheet. some analysts have anticipated specifics of a tapering to be revealed in the may fomc minutes; while the conversation of shrinking the fed’s balance sheet was no doubt readdressed at last month's meeting, details or a conclusive pathway are unlikely to be unveiled. addressing the balance sheet with a scheduled taper of monthly purchases will no doubt impact the pace of additional interest rate increases, slowing the pathway to reaching the expected terminal level on the fed funds rate, as tapering itself will be seen as a de facto act of tightening. in other words, if the expected terminal rate on fed funds is 3%, as many officials have suggested, and the anticipated timeframe of reaching said level is around two to three years, now, addressing the balance sheet during that same period could extend the timeframe from reaching the terminal level to five years, maybe more. nevertheless, at the point, according to bloomberg, the probability of a rate hike at the upcoming june 14th fomc meeting remains elevated at near 100%. in addition to the above, here are five things to watch for courtesy of the wsj : 1. how likely is a june rate increase? the fed last raised short-term rates in march, and it penciled in two additional quarter-percentage-point increases this year. june offers a good opportunity for another move: the meeting is followed by a press conference by chairwoman janet yellen, and raising rates a second time in the first half of 2017 would give officials more time to evaluate how the economy evolves before considering a third increase in the second half of the year. expectations for a june rate increase are high. a recent wall street journal survey found 88% of economists expected such a move. traders in futures markets place an 83% likelihood of a move in june, according to cme group. the minutes could either confirm or confound that expectation. 2. weak economic growth one argument for holding off on a june rate increase could be the economy’s mixed performance since march. inflation wobbled recently: the fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, briefly exceeded the fed’s annual 2% target in february but slipped below it again in march, as prices rose 1.8%. economic growth in the first quarter also disappointed, with gross domestic product expanding at a 0.7% annual rate. however, the fed said in its may policy statement that the slowing was “likely to be transitory,” suggesting the central bank wasn’t overly worried about the slump. also on the plus side, the unemployment rate has fallen further since the fed last raised rates, to 4.4% in april, its lowest level in a decade. the minutes could provide more detail on officials’ assessment of the economy’s health. 3. slimming the balance sheet a point of interest in the may minutes will be officials’ discussion of how and when to start shrinking the fed’s portfolio of bonds and other assets. minutes of the fed’s march policy meeting indicated officials wanted to begin the process by the end of the year, but questions remained over the pace of reductions and the size of the holdings when they finish. the fed’s balance sheet has grown to $4.5 trillion, or around 23% of u.s. gross domestic product, from less than $1 trillion, or around 6%, before the financial crisis. reducing its size without roiling markets will be a delicate task. officials in march were careful to note they wanted to proceed in a “gradual and predictable” way, likely to avoid a rerun of the 2013 “taper tantrum,” when the prospect that the fed would slow its asset purchases set off market volatility, including a spike in treasury yields and large capital outflows from many emerging-market economies. 4. fiscal policy fed officials continue to assess whether the trump administration’s proposed tax cuts, spending plans, regulatory changes or other policies could boost economic growth and drive up inflation. minutes of the fed’s march meeting showed most officials saw a possibility that the economy could perform better than they expected because of possible new tax and spending policies. minutes of the may meeting could provide a more recent snapshot of their thinking. 5. challenging assumptions a couple of fed officials have cast doubts on the strength of the labor market recently, and that will be a point to watch in the minutes. although the unemployment rate hit an ultralow 4.4% last month, there hasn’t been a breakout in inflation. economists would usually expect inflation to rise when joblessness gets low as companies compete for scarcer workers by offering higher wages. over the past few weeks, several fed officials have said the labor market has returned to full employment, which means essentially every worker looking for a job can find one. but two officials, fed governor lael brainard and minneapolis fed president neel kashkari, have expressed doubts about that in recent days, arguing there might be further room for improvement in the labor market since the low joblessness hasn’t meaningfully boosted prices. details of this debate could show up in the may minutes, and could indicate some officials might be inclined to keep rates lower for longer to help push up wages. additionally, bofa highlights 4 issues which could hinder the fed's plans going forward: of the above, #2 may be most important as the fed has increasingly warned that stocks are getting ahead of themselves, and it is possible that yellen will hike just to take out some of the froth in stocks. finally, in terms of market reaction, bloomberg points out that the latest cftc data shows the most extreme speculator positions currently sit in 10y futures , which recently grew to heaviest longs since january 2008, while futures positioning remains near record shorts across eurodollars. this turnaround in speculator ty longs has been sharp, following the biggest short unwind on record that occurred three weeks ago.  on the other end, speculator eurodollar shorts remain near record levels. the conclusion is that near record long ty coupled with short eurodollar positioning among speculator accounts leaves the market open to exacerbated moves. this means that a dovish take on the minutes may see sharp short-covering across front eurodollars, leading treasury prices higher further out the curve, while a hawkish outcome could see intermediates out to 10s lead a wider move lower in price as accounts look to take profits on recently built-up longs . finally, a potential reason for dovish take may be soft cpi and retail sales data from may 12, while a dismissal of the data as “transitory” may result in a more hawkish view . going into the minutes, current odds of a june hike based on ois probabilities sit at 76%; a full hike and further 4bp is priced in for september; almost 1.5 hikes is priced in by year-end. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com

1449,Here Is The Latest Breakdown Of Fed Hawks And Doves,2017-05-24 17:20:00+00:00,"ahead of today's fomc minutes, ubs reminds us that there has been substantial turnover on the fomc, and so the swiss bank has updated its periodic commentary on fomc participants, as well as its popular ""hawk-dove"" chart. while many of the actors are well-known, there are some unknowns and unfamiliar faces, with more to come. the biggest unknowns are raphael bostic, the brand new president in atlanta and how the richmond fed will factor into the debate after jeffrey lacker's departure. in addition, with three vacancies on the board and chair yellen and vice chair fischer's terms ending early next year, there will be considerable turnover. here is the full breakdown of the fed's latest ""nest"", from ubs' seth carpenter. the new scale first, raphael bostic, the new president of the federal reserve bank of atlanta has not established a track record to judge. that said, bostic is a very smart, well-trained economist, who is comfortable mixing theory and empirical work, so a good guess is that he will not initially be at either extreme. also uncertain is the role of the federal reserve bank of richmond. jeff lacker resigned after acknowledging leaking fomc information in 2012. the first vice president of the bank gets to take his place, but it is hard to know how that will play out. richmond is not a voting member this year, so the distinction is slightly less critical. among the hawks on our scale, the easiest calls are esther george (frb-kansas city) and patrick harker (frb-philadelphia). both have been consistently hawkish in tone. loretta mester (frb-cleveland) is a career fed economist, having worked for charlie plosser (a noted hawk) at the philadelphia fed. she is less doctrinally hawkish than her old boss and takes a nuanced view of the data, although she usually interprets  them with something of a hawkish tilt. eric rosengren (frb-boston) has become hawkish in recent years, motivated less by inflation fears than by financial stability concerns. his policy prescriptions have become consistently to the hawkish side of the committee. we see a large set of centrists on the committee, large enough to shade some participants to one side or the other. a final note on voting. we have separated voters from non-voters, as is customary. one should keep in mind, however, that in practice, all fomc participants take part in the debate. the recording of the vote and number of dissents matters, but the fomc has been run as a consensus-driven body for a long time, and the distinction between voter and non-voter is typically overstated. and visually: tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Neel Kashkari Federal Reserve Bill Dudley Richmond Fed Jeff Lacker John Williams Federal Reserve Bank,1

1467,"China Downgrade Forgotten As Asia Closes Higher, Futures Flat Ahead Of Fed Minutes",2017-05-24 11:40:00+00:00,"not even last night's moody's credit downgrade of china - the first since 1989 - could dent the global stock rally which has pushed global stock prices to all time highs. after initially sliding, regional stocks and emerging asian currencies pared early losses following the unexpected downgrade of china, taking their cue from the ""sudden reversal"" of the shanghai composite index, which some speculated saw the latest intervention of the ""national team."" moody’s action on china briefly rattled asian markets, but against a backdrop of strengthening global growth and the impending release of minutes from the federal reserve’s latest meeting, investors appeared to quickly move on. msci's broadest index of asia-pacific shares outside japan was unchanged while japan's nikkei stock index ended 0.7 percent higher. the shanghai composite gained 0.1% at the close, reversing an early decline of 1%, while the offshore yuan inched up. as reported last night, the major overnight catalyst in asia was moody's downgrade of china’s credit rating to a1 from aa3 in early asia trading, citing a worsening outlook for the nation’s financial strength - in the end of the chinese session it had little impact, aside from another steep selloff in iron ore, which traded nearly limit down. the downgrade impact on regional currencies was likewise limited as asia’s economic growth is seen to be improving and there are still positive stories such as s&p’s upgrade of indonesia’s rating last week. by the end of the session, nobody even remembered china had been downgraded: the shanghai composite rose 0.1 percent, reversing a drop of 1.3 percent. the hang seng also ended higher after an earlier decline of 0.4 percent. japan’s topix index climbed 0.6 percent, while indonesia’s benchmark index slumped 0.7 percent. the australian dollar slipped 0.1 percent, paring a steeper drop of as much as 0.5 percent. away from asia, european stocks rose and u.s. equity futures and the dollar both steadied. the stoxx europe 600 index climbed a second day, but struggled to gain momentum as miners slumped after china's downgrade. that triggered declines across copper, nickel, zinc and iron ore. the british pound strengthened after two days of losses, even as prime minister theresa may warned that further terrorist attacks could be imminent. ""there's been a cautious start in europe this morning with stocks in the red following a downgrade in the chinese credit rating from moody's,"" said david cheetham, chief market analyst at brokerage xtb. ""after being very much at the front and center of global risk sentiment at the beginning of last year, the chinese slowdown story has been almost forgotten, with politics throughout europe and the u.s. taking the limelight."" s&p500 futures were little changed as investors awaited economic data and earnings reports, while volatility dropped for a fifth day. s&p 500 contracts expiring in june added less than 0.1% to 2,398.5 at 6:30 a.m. in new york. crude extended gains a sixth day as opec prepared for thursday’s key meeting in vienna, and where an announcement of a 9 month productin cut extension now is fully priced in. in currencies, the dollar was little changed against most of its peers and treasury yields were steady before the u.s. federal reserve releases later wednesday the minutes of its may 3 policy meeting. with fed due to release its may meeting minutes, “markets are ready to catch any clue regarding the likelihood of an interest- rate hike at the fomc’s june meeting,” writes ipek ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at london capital group. fed bank of philadelphia president patrick harker said june “is a distinct possibility” for the u.s. central bank’s second interest-rate increase of 2017. while equities quickly forgot the downgrade of china, the world's top user of materials, industrial metals were far more bruised, as nickel slumped 1.9% and copper fell 0.6%. iron ore futures dropped 4.7%.  west texas oil rose 0.2 percent to $51.56 a barrel, adding to a five-day advance ahead of tomorrow's opec meeting. old added 0.1 percent to $1,252.30 an ounce, after dropping 0.8 percent on tuesday. elsewhere the australian dollar fell and the yen pared losses against the u.s. currency after moody’s investors service cut its rating on china’s debt for the first time in almost three decades. the euro was little changed ahead of the fed minutes, even as ecb policy makers warned of the dangers of the ‘ripple effect’ from the house price boom and ‘significant’ bond risks spurring increased debt concerns. in rates, the yield on 10-year treasury notes fell less than one basis point to 2.27 percent. bonds fell during the previous four days. yields on benchmark french, german and british bonds all dropped two basis points. today investors await the minutes of the u.s. federal reserve's latest policy meeting, scheduled to be released at 2pm. fed funds futures show that traders now see a 75% chance that the u.s. central bank would will raise interest rates at its june meeting. ""our u.s. economists expect the minutes to come down on the hawkish side and continue to expect the fed to hike in june and september and announce balance sheet reduction in december,"" citi analysts wrote on wednesday. bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot top overnight news from bloomberg asia equity markets traded mixed following the mildly positive us close, where indices eked a 4th consecutive daily gain and the s&p 500 briefly advanced above 2,400 to within close proximity of its all-time highs. this provided the initial impetus for the asx 200 (flat) and nikkei 225 (+0.3%), while jpy weakness also underpinned japanese exporter sentiment. conversely, shanghai comp. (+0.1%) and hang seng (flat) underperformed after moody's downgraded china's sovereign credit rating amid expectations of a deterioration in china's financial strength in the upcoming years. 10yr jgbs traded lower on spill-over selling from t-notes and alongside the increased risk sentiment in japan, although downside was stemmed amid the boj's presence in the market for a total jpy 1.03trl in 1yr-10yrs government debt. moody's downgraded china's sovereign credit rating to al from aa3; outlook revised to stable from negative. moody's commented that the rating reflects expectations that china's financial strength will erode somewhat over the approaching years. pboc injected cny 40bin in 7-day reverse repos and cny 50bin in 14-day reverse repos. the pboc set cny mid-point at 6.8758 (prey. 6.8661) top asian news european equities trade with little in the way of firm direction (eurostoxx 50 flat) as earnings season continues to peter out and markets shrug of overnight news that moody's downgraded china's sovereign debt rating. chinese bourses were initially hit on the news given the surprise of the timing but ultimately the action taken is of little surprise given debt concerns and moody's bringing their rating in-line with that of fitch and as such european traders have largely looked through the announcement. on a sector stand-point, energy names outperform ahead of this week's opec meeting despite a lack of clarity on the duration of any potential extension. material names underperform amid dalian ore futures sliding over 5% over night. in fixed income markets, price action has been particularly uneventful with prices stuck in a somewhat narrow range. in peripheral markets, spreads are also relatively unchanged to their core counterparts with markets most likely looking for further direction from today's speech by ecb's draghi and any further update on the greek situation after the imf and german finance minister schauble reportedly struck an agreement on greek bailout with the imf willing to participate in the program if greece proves debt is sustainable. top european news in currencies, the bloomberg dollar spot index was flat after climbing 0.3 percent tuesday. the pound rose 0.1 percent to $1.2971 following a two-day loss. the euro fell by less than 0.1 percent to $1.1178. it has been a very quiet morning in fx and if anything stands out it is the resilience in the cross jpy rates. this is in the face of the moody's downgrade of china's credit rating, which garnered brief attention in asia, but little else. usd/jpy has tested 112.00, but good selling interest seen here despite a small tip over the figure level. eur/usd is still in pullback mode, but fresh demand coming in already. the fomc minutes ahead may underpin expectations of a jun move, and this should see usd bids picking up dips — 1.1200 intact as a result. not that this is deterring cable buyers still intent on tripping stops through 1.3060-70. we see little other reason for the resilient bid tone in the pound given what lies ahead, with some suggesting traders are pre-empting a tory win in the elections. we doubt this would lead to a significant charge higher from current levels, but impulsive markets are here to stay. in commodities, iron ore led metals lower across the board today as the overnight markets reacted to the moody's downgrade of china's credit rating. the dce lost over 4.5% today, with the indices here requiring little to tip the balance these days. copper has found some resistance at usd2.60 as many anticipated, but the pullback has been tame so far to suggest a more consolidative tone going forward. all eyes on oil prices at the present time, and with the opec meeting not until tomorrow, but ongoing rhetoric supportive of an extension — though to what degree. 6 months is the minimum required to keep wti above usd50.00, currently trading closer to usd52.00 while brent is in the upper usd54.00's. precious metals are out of the spotlight, but silver has crept back above usd17.00. looking at today’s calendar, we’ll get the march fhfa house price index reading and also april existing home sales data. this evening we then get the fomc minutes from the meeting on may 3rd where most be will combing through for discussion on the fed’s balance sheet strategy. it’s another busy day for fedspeak today too with kaplan (6pm ) and kashkari (6.30pm ) both scheduled. ecb president draghi also speaks in madrid at 1.45pm bst. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap back in 1990 in an attempt to impress the young ladies on the school bus which we shared with the girls school next door i started watching twin peaks. i hated it but had to continue watching in case i could possibly be part of their arty, seemingly sophisticated conversation. they adored it (the show, not my input sadly). so it was some intrigue to me that a new series aired this week 25 years after the last one. i haven't watched it yet but i wonder whether any of it will make sense. for the uninitiated it was a surreal, confusing supernatural drama that amongst other things included a red room where everyone spoke backwards. at 16 this was the height of cool and it was the most popular show of 1990. thankfully the days of trying to impress a potential new partner are over. what impresses my wife most these days is me changing a nappy so i do that when i can instead. talking of twin peaks, us equities have again edged up towards the highs after the s&p 500 closed last night within 0.30% of the all time peak from intraday last tuesday before all the political headlines hit. the index was up +0.18% yesterday which means it has now gained for four consecutive sessions. you’d have to go back to february to find the last time it did that. the dow (+0.21%) also edged up while there was a similarly positive mood in europe with the stoxx 600 (+0.22%) also finishing in positive territory. some decent pmis on both sides of the pond seemed to be the catalyst (we’ll come to those shortly) and it didn’t hurt that oil continues to solidify gains. indeed wti (+0.66%) was up for the fifth day in a row yesterday and is holding above $51/bbl ahead of tomorrow’s opec meeting where there was more chatter yesterday from energy ministers that a nine-month extension agreement appears likely. in bond markets treasuries (+2.6bps) and bunds (+1.3bps) were a little weaker while in currencies the us dollar (+0.38%) was up for only the second time in the last nine sessions. needless to say that the tragic events in manchester dominated the front pages around the world with uk pm theresa may subsequently raising the terror alert in the uk to ‘critical’ from ‘severe’. sterling (-0.30%) was a touch weaker yesterday and is holding just below $1.300 this morning. before we go any further, the main news to report overnight is moody’s cutting china’s sovereign credit rating by one notch to a1/stable (was previously on negative outlook). that is the first time moody’s have cut china’s rating since 1989. the rating agency noted the likelihood of a “material rise” in economy-wide debt and expectations that china’s financial strength could “erode somewhat” as a result. china’s rating at moody’s is now level with that of japan and below other asia economies of taiwan and macau. while there were no real revelations in the moody’s statement the timing appears to have caught markets by surprise a little. equity markets in china initially fell sharply on the news and while having pared back some of the losses, are still underperforming this morning. the shanghai comp is currently -0.63% and at the lowest level in nearly 8 months. it was initially down as much as -1.28%, while the csi 300 and shenzhen are -0.75% and -0.19% respectively. the hang seng is now flat after being in the red. both the onshore (-0.10%) and offshore (-0.05%) renminbi are a shade weaker, while china’s sovereign 5y cds is 1bp wider. the china sensitive aussie dollar is also down -0.40%. elsewhere in asia bourses are firmer and seemingly following the lead from wall street. the nikkei (+0.48%), asx (+0.10%) and kospi (+0.20%) are all up. away from markets, there were some interesting comments to come from the ecb’s benoit coeure yesterday. speaking at a conference in paris, coeure said that “our current analysis of the secondary effects of negative rates suggest that there is no reason to change the indications we’ve given”. the board member also said that the ecb would start raising rates “well beyond the horizon” of asset purchases. last week coeure had said that the future path for rates was “not set in stone”. this suggests that the ecb is not about to change sequencing and is important as coeure was previously seen as someone who had  suggested a change in sequencing previously. we should get more hints at next month’s ecb meeting. another focus for the market yesterday was trump’s budget. despite the wide acknowledgment that it stands little chance of being passed as proposed it was interesting to look at some of the details still. one questionable aspect is that the plan assumes that us economic growth would reach 3% by 2021 whereas the fed and congressional budget office project the us economy growing at an annual rate of just 1.8% and 1.9% in the coming years. in addition, the budget assumes to only balance in 10 years through strong growth. this follows the point we made in yesterday’s emr about the uk not seeing a balanced budget  until 2025 in the conservative party’s manifesto. indeed one wonders how budgets will ever balance again in most countries especially given the demographic headwinds. staying with the us the white house issued a statement yesterday saying that it does not confirm or deny ‘unsubstantiated claims based on illegal leaks from anonymous individuals’ concerning the investigation of the links between russia and trump’s presidential campaign. a reminder that former fbi director james comey is likely to testify next week which will no doubt be a talking point for the market. back to those pmis yesterday. in europe the flash may composite for the euro area came in at a fairly solid 56.8 which was modestly better than what the market was expecting and steady versus the april reading. the manufacturing reading edged up 0.3pts to 57.0 (vs. 56.5 expected) which offset a 0.2pt decline in the services reading to 56.2 (vs. 56.4 expected). in the country details there was a positive read-through in the data for both germany and france. the former saw its composite rise 0.6pts to 57.3, driven by the manufacturing sector while the latter saw its composite rise 1pt to 57.6, driven by the  services sector. this does however imply a roughly 1.1pt decline in the average composite for the periphery. taken as whole, the composite reading for the euro area implies gdp growth in q2 of +0.8% qoq according to our economists, compared to their forecast of +0.5% qoq. across the pond, the composite flash may reading in the us came in at 53.9 which was up 0.7pts from april. the details were a little more mixed however with the driver of the increase in the composite coming from the services sector where the pmi rose 0.9pts to 54.0. the manufacturing pmi actually edged down 0.3pts to 52.5. away from the pmis, the rest of the data in the us was a tad disappointing. new home sales fell sharply in april (-11.4% mom vs. -1.8% expected) albeit from a march reading which was revised up to an almost 10-year high. meanwhile the richmond fed manufacturing index tumbled 19pts to +1 (vs. +15 expected), confirming some of the weaker data in the factory sector. in germany q1 gdp was confirmed as growing +0.6% qoq while the ifo business climate reading in may was revealed as climbing 1.6pts to a better than expected 114.6 (vs. 113.1 expected). the present situation index actually hit a new multi- decade high while the expectations index rose to its highest since february 2014. finally in the uk the cbi’s distributive trades survey was disappointing with a net 2% of respondents reporting higher sales in may, down from 38% in april. before we wrap up and look at the day ahead, it’s worth highlighting that german press outlet handelsblatt was running a story yesterday suggesting that the imf and german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble have reportedly reached an agreement on greece. the article suggests that the imf has signalled its willingness to participate in the program and would only provide money if greece proves its debt is sustainable. looking at today’s calendar, the only data due out in europe this morning comes from germany where the flash june consumer confidence reading is due. this afternoon in the us we’ll get the march fhfa house price index reading and also april existing home sales data. this evening we then get the fomc minutes from the meeting on may 3rd where most be will combing through for discussion on the fed’s balance sheet strategy. it’s another busy day for fedspeak today too with kaplan (11pm bst) and kashkari (11.30pm bst) both scheduled. ecb president draghi also speaks in madrid at 1.45pm bst while praet  speaks this morning. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ]

1528,S&P Futs Near All Time High On Strong Euro Data; Oil Drops On Trump's SPR Sale Plans,2017-05-23 12:01:00+00:00,"s&p futures rose alongside european stocks as asian shares posted modest declines. the euro set a new six-month high and european bourses rose as pmi data from germany and france signaled that the ecb will have to tighten soon as europe's recovery remains on track, with the german ifo business confidence printing at the highest level on record, and hinting at a gdp print in the 5% range. oil declined after the trump budget proposal suggested selling half the crude held in the us strategic petroleum reserve. strong economic survey data across the eurozone supported eu bourses, despite a cautious start to trade after last night's deadly terror attack in the uk. alongside strong headline numbers, one of the most eye-catching details in the data was the biggest manufacturing sector job growth reading in the survey's 20-year-history and overall employment gains were the second best in a decade. ""it's a very good result and it's broad based. we've got a good pace of growth here. the fact we have maintained this high level in may is great news for second quarter gdp,"" said chris williamson, chief business economist at ihs markit."" just like in the us, tech companies helped propell the stoxx europe 600 index higher after nokia oyj settled a litigation with apple. the u.k.’s ftse 100 index rose a third day, the pound pared declines and gilts were steady after the manchester bombing. the dollar declined after the washington post reported donald trump asked intelligence chiefs to publicly deny collusion between his campaign and russia, a potentially impeachable offense. the u.s. president in march asked director of national intelligence daniel coats and nsa director michael rogers to publicly deny existence of any collusion between his campaign and the russian government, the washington post reported, citing unidentified current and former officials. oil dropped, halting a four-day rising streak that took the price of crude above $51 a barrel. it wasn't just the german ifo surge: a euro-area purchasing managers’ index showed manufacturing in the bloc expanded at the fastest pace in more than six years, bolstering the case for an ecb rate hike and further capital flows out of the us and into europe as political wrangling in washington rumbles on, diverting attention from president trump’s spending and tax plans. “europe’s growth numbers aren’t knocking the skin off the ball, but they are less volatile and it’s doing relatively well compared to the u.s., u.k. and japan,” said bill blain, head of capital markets at london-based mint partners. “more than a few global investors have lost faith in the u.s. recovery and trump jump.” there was some bad news: signs that euro zone authorities and the international monetary fund remain some way apart on greece's debt problems combined with the strong data to nag at bond markets. greece's short-dated government bond yields rose sharply as the imf's chief negotiator stuck to its stance that there needs to be more realism on what athens can deliver. the prospect of the ecb scaling down its multi trillion euro stimulus program meanwhile nudged up yields on german bunds de10yt=tweb and other higher-rated government debt. ""the risk-off environment is already erased and we are back to the levels we saw yesterday on the back of the very bright economic outlook,"" said dz bank analyst rene abrecht. the stoxx europe 600 index gained 0.2 percent in early trading. the u.k.’s ftse 100 index added 0.1 percent. futures on the s&p 500 climbed 0.1 percent after the underlying gauge rose 0.5 percent on monday. the selloff in brazilian assets resumed on monday. the next funds ibovespa linked exchange traded fund, an equity etf that tracks brazil’s benchmark index, slumped 3.9 percent in tokyo trading tuesday. asian trading had seen a modest pull back in risk appetite with msci's broadest index of asia-pacific shares not including japan dropping back from near two-year highs. tokyo's nikkei closed down 0.3 percent as japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the slowest pace in six months in may, while trading in china was choppy on concerns over a regulatory crackdown on risky lending practices. japan’s topix dropped 0.2 percent after swinging between gains and losses. south korea’s kospi rose 0.3 percent. hong kong’s hang seng fell 0.1 percent. the shanghai composite index lost 0.5 percent. the dollar remained in the doldrums too. it dipped to a 6-1/2-month low against a basket of other major currencies as low 10-year u.s. treasury yields continued to underscore fading expectations for fiscal stimulus from the trump administration. of note, today the white house will present trump's first full budget plan to lawmakers on tuesday. its proposals include a $3.6 trillion cut in government spending over 10 years, balancing the budget by the end of the decade. congress holds the federal purse strings and often ignores presidential budgets, which are proposals and may not take effect in its current form. but the plan, which advocated selling half of strategic u.s. oil reserves, weighed on crude futures according to reuters , offsetting optimism over expectations that other major oil producers would agree to extend supply curbs this week. brent retreated 0.8 percent to$53.44 a barrel. u.s. crude futures gave up all their earlier gains to edge lower to $50.71, after hitting their highest level in more than a month earlier in the session. the weaker dollar, meanwhile, lifted gold slightly. spot gold climbed 0.1 percent to $1,261.56 an ounce in its third straight session of gains. this afternoon sees us new home sales and the much-ignored markit manufacturing pmi. neither is expected to be much-changed from last month. the big event for the us market is the fomc minutes tomorrow. ""the big question for markets is how fast investors get back to the business of hunting carry"" according to socgen's kit juckes. ""i am watching usd/brl which has stabilised after last week's spike, and if this starts to edge down again while us equities move towards new highs, that would increase the likelihood of a june fed rate hike rate, while also supporting all the higher-yielding currencies. that does, in g10fx, lead to nzd/jpy."" bulletin headline summary from ransquawk global market snapshot top headline news asia equity markets traded with a cautious tone amid terror fears following the explosion in manchester, uk where 19 people were confirmed dead and over 50 others injured, which police are treating as a terrorist attack. this dampened the risk tone in asx 200 (-0.3%) and nikkei 225 (-0.3%), although markets in australia attempted to recover as gains in commodities-related sectors provided support. hang seng (+0.1%) and shanghai comp. (-0.5%) were mixed with downside stemmed after the pboc conducted a firm liquidity injection of cny 140bin. finally, 10yr jgbs were relatively flat with only mild upside observed despite the cautious risk tone observed in equities, while the enhanced liquidity auction also saw a muted reaction and failed to drive any significant demand. top asian news in european markets, strong pmi and ifo surveys across the eurozone have supported eu bourses this morning to trade risk-on, following stellar readings from france and germany in particular, where the mfg. figure rose to 59.4, ahead of the exp. 58. subsequently, offsetting the slip in crude oil futures which stemmed from comments by the kuwait oil minister who stated that not everyone is on board with 9-month extension. this is somewhat of a contrast to rhetoric from the saudi energy minister, who kept alive hopes by stating that there is no objection to a 9-month deal. of note, equities have pulled off highs amid reports that south korea have fired warning shots following an unidentified object flying south from north korea. in credit markets, government bonds have reversed their in ftq amid the risk on sentiment. notable underperformance observed in the greek short end after reports that greece's creditors failed to reach an agreement on greek debt measures and held off releasing new funds to greece. additionally, belgium have now opened books for their eur 20yr with reports noting that demand has exceeded eur 8.85b1n. elsewhere, supply from the uk and germany has been well digested. top european news in currencies, the bloomberg dollar spot index dropped for a third day, falling 0.1 percent to head for the lowest level since nov. 4. the yen rose 0.2 percent to 111.13 per dollar. the pound was little changed at $1.2996 after weakening as much as 0.4 percent. the euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1258. across fx markets, the news of the terror attack in manchester has dominated the headlines, which prompted some mild gbp selling to trip below 1.30, although, bids layered in 1.2950 curbed further downside. eur still feeling the upward momentum, now helped by the strong eurozone pmi readings. nzd remains on the front foot off the back of optimistic expectations from the budget later this week. the local press have been shedding a positive light on some of the economy friendly measure. we have the fonterra dairy auction later today, so this may test the nzd resolve which sees the spot rate above 0.7000 and aud/nzd back in the mid 1.0600's. as can be said of a number of pairings in the majors, there look to be over-extensions of note, and some will be justified in attributing this to usd/jpy given the marginal price action see in treasury yields. sub 111.00 looks to be running into demand as we cannot ignore the prospect of a fed rate hike in june. as we have spoken of in recent weeks, the market is also looking at the longer term perspective of the us rate path, but in light of this, the data has faded at best, so we expect some consolidation in the usd at these levels as we await more data. in commodities, wti and brent crude futures enter the north american crossover in negative territory as concerns continue to mount regarding the factions within the cartel and whether all players are on board with output curbs. more specifically, the kuwait oil minister says that not everyone has agreed to a 9-month output extension but is agreed on a 6-month extension, while adding that deeper cuts are not being discussed. crude oil prices also took a hit after the chinese customs highlighted that china's crude imports from russia and saudi arabia fell 1.9% and 3.9% respectively in april. in metals markets, gold prices are mildly higher due to a weaker usd and safe-haven flows in the wake of the manchester arena explosion, while copper prices failed to maintain traction as risk sentiment in the region turned cautious. looking at the day ahead, in the us we’ll get the flash may pmis along with april new home sales and may richmond fed manufacturing index. away from the data, the fed’s kashkari is scheduled to speak again at two separate events while the fed’s harker speaks at 5pm et. the other big focus for today will be the trump’s administration budget request where we are expecting to get alot more details on the back of the skinny budget released back in march and some of the leaks this morning. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap awful news this morning for those of us in the uk after a suspected terrorist attack at a concert in manchester late last night which has taken the lives of 19 people and left another 50 injured. if confirmed as a terrorist attack it will be the largest such atrocity on these shores since the 2005 london bombings. safe haven assets are a little stronger this morning with 10y treasury yields -1.7bps and gold +0.15%. sterling (-0.10%) is slightly weaker. the nikkei (-0.12%) is a touch softer but most other markets in asia are flat to slightly higher. indeed the asx is +0.03% while the hang seng (+0.30%), shanghai comp (+0.18%) and kospi (+0.92%) are firmer. also worth highlighting overnight is the news that s&p had moved to place brazil’s sovereign bb rating on credit watch negative. brazilian assets had resumed their selloff yesterday with the bovespa down -1.54%, brazilian real weakening -0.38% and local currency bond yields 30bps higher. also bloomberg is reporting that president trump is to announce $3.6tn in tax cuts over the next 10 years at today’s much anticipated budget plan. the proposal will supposedly claim to balance the budget within a decade. as we’ve noted before however it appears that the republican-led congress is likely to largely ignore the proposal. today's main market story outside of the uk attack are the global flash pmis. the strong ytd performance in equities has matched the strong recent performance of global pmis so on this measure the rally is not out of line with the data. of the main regions, china has perhaps seen the weakest pmi readings and it's notable that whilst us/european equities are up around 10-25% ytd, chinese equities are slightly down. with this in mind today's flash pmis from around the globe will give us an early sign to whether momentum is continuing at an elevated pace. in europe the expectations are for broadly unchanged numbers for services and manufacturing with a 55 or 56 handle. in the us also broadly unchanged with a 53 handle for both. a sizeable move in either direction around this consensus would likely drive equities over the next few weeks. we’ll actually have to wait until next week to receive china’s pmis but this morning japan released its manufacturing pmi which came in at 52.0 for may versus 52.7 in april. this comes after market sentiment continues to improve after the us political shocks of last week. the s&p 500 (+0.52%) rose for the third consecutive session yesterday and is now up 1.76% from last week’s intraday lows and also back to within half of a percent of the all time high mark again. the dow (+0.43%), nasdaq (+0.82%) and russell 2000 (+0.72%) indices also had a decent session despite there not really being much news. in fact the lack of any trump-related headlines was probably a positive for sentiment although some of the deals struck with saudi arabia over the weekend were seen as a boost for markets. the vix also plunged over 9% and closed back below its ytd average at 10.93. markets in europe were a bit more benign (stoxx 600 -0.09%) with banks down for the fourth time in five days. helping sentiment at the margin were higher oil prices with wti oil (+0.91%) closing above $51/bbl for the first time since april 18th. this comes ahead of thursday’s opec meeting where expectations are seemingly high for an extension to the supply cut agreement. in fact the rest of the commodity complex was generally firmer with gold (+0.37%), iron ore (+0.80%), copper (+0.37%) and zinc (+0.67%) all edging up. the one asset which is struggling to recover from the trump-inspired selloff from last week is the us dollar (-0.16%) which fell for the 7th time in the last 8 sessions yesterday. that wasn’t helped by the strong day for the euro though (+0.28%) which bounced after german chancellor merkel called the single currency “too weak” (albeit in the context of germany’s trade surplus). as a longer term aside on the current and future financing of government debt, yesterday the uk conservative party seemed to take a care policy u-turn on their campaign trail. the reforms announced in their manifesto last week basically meant that more people would have to use their home to fund future elderly care down to their last £100,000. however the backlash led to remarks from pm mrs may yesterday that they would consult on having a maximum amount that any person would be forced to pay. this comes only a couple of months after the same government announced a u-turn on taxing self employees people slightly more to be closer to other employees in the economy. this follows the previous chancellor george osborne reversing a cut in tax credits (announced in 2015) for millions of low-paid families after immense and very public criticism. with the uk not seeing a budget surplus since 2001 (only very briefly after many prior years of big deficits) and with the conservative party last week delaying a return to a balanced budget to 2025 in their manifesto one wonders how budgets will ever balance again when any tax increases or welfare cuts are very quickly reversed when shown as unpopular. this is not a uk only phenomenon (well done germany though) but this recent activity in the uk surely is reflective of a wider global issue of how to collect more in tax than you spend, especially as we get older, all have a vote and the working age population shrinks or growth stalls across the developed world. it's one of the reasons we think that helicopter money will eventually be prevalent. governments can't cut deficits too much without major backlash. in the end it'll be easier to monetise them. on that note, following another set of marathon talks yesterday negotiations between greece’s creditors failed to yield a deal on debt relief at last night’s eurogroup meeting. the imf and germany were supposedly in disagreement over the amount of debt relief required to assure economic stability in greece. eurogroup chair jeroen dijsselbloem said that it is still a priority to bring the imf on board and that work will continue in the coming weeks with the hope that a deal can be concluded on june 15th at the next scheduled meeting for eurogroup ministers. as a reminder greece faces around €7bn of debt maturities in july. onto credit, the latest ecb cspp numbers were out yesterday and i was surprised to see the average daily corporate purchases at €401mn last week, notably above the average daily run rate of €365mn since the program started. so back in april and early may it looked like a broadly equal cspp/pspp split but last week's numbers gives us the possibility that cspp hasn't been tapered as much after all. just wrapping up the remaining newsflow yesterday, with no significant data out there was a bit of focus on the fedspeak yesterday. the dallas fed’s kaplan said that he still favoured two more rate hikes this year and a balance sheet reduction to start later this year. on inflation kaplan said that “recent readings are likely not indicative of a weakening trend...and as slack continues to be removed from the labour market, headline inflation should reach, or exceed, the fed’s 2% longer-run objective in the medium term”. over at the ecb the bundesbank’s weidmann reiterated that inflation pressures are currently “muted” but that they should increase “with the continued economic upswing and gradual decline in unemployment in the euro area”. looking at the day ahead, we’ve got a fairly busy diary to get through in europe this morning. shortly after this hits your email we’ll get the final revisions to q1 gdp in germany (no change to the +0.6% qoq flash print expected) as well as details around the growth drivers. shortly after that we get may confidence indicators out of france before all eyes turn to those flash may pmis. later on this morning we’ll get the may ifo survey out of germany and public sector net borrowing data in the uk for april. this afternoon in the us we’ll also get the flash may pmis along with april new home sales and may richmond fed manufacturing index. away from the data, the fed’s kashkari is scheduled to speak again at two separate events (2pm bst and 8pm bst) while the fed’s harker speaks at 10pm bst. the ecb’s coeure speaks this afternoon too. the other big focus for today will be the trump’s administration budget request where we are expecting to get alot more details on the back of the skinny budget released back in march and some of the leaks this morning. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising:

1577,"JPM Cuts 10Y Yield Forecasts ""Significantly Lower"" Due To Weaker Inflation Outlook",2017-05-22 16:35:00+00:00,"just one day after goldman reluctantly cut its 2017 year end forecast on the 10y yield last friday from 3.00% to 2.75%, "" reflecting some added uncertainty on the us macro outlook "" while conceded that ""bond bears"", i.e., those clients who have listened to it, "" have had a difficult 2017"" it was jpmorgan's turn, and over the weekend jpm announced it was adjusting its us rate forecast ""significantly lower"", slashing its year end 10y yield target to 2.75% from 3%, reflecting “ a weaker outlook on core inflation and reduced expectations around tax reform and infrastructure spending.” in the note by jpm's jay barry, the bank also trimmed most other tenor forecasts by 15bp-35bp lower, saying that the inflation outlook “has changed markedly” over past month based on weakness in core cpi in march and april. jpm also said that  as for fiscal stimulus, odds are rising that it “gets pushed into fy18.” and also just like goldman, jpm tried to hedge adding that ""even so, ust yields should rise in coming weeks,” because markets ""continue to underprice the risk of further fed tightening,” and yields “have consistently risen” ahead of fomc meetings that include sep and press conference; also, treasuries “appear locally rich to other dm government bond markets.” finally, jpm maintains its recommendation to hold shorts in the 3-year sector and urges 10s30s flatteners, as the curve is ~3bp too steep adjusted for market’s medium-term fed and inflation expectations. meanwhile, the fed funds market continues to be blissfully disconnected from the recent sharp slowdown in us economic data surprises, which as noted previously has posted one of the biggest drops on record, and if the disappointment persists, it is not impossible that the fed will punts its june rate hike which the market now assumes is virtually assured. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Bond CPI Core CPI,1

1590,"FX Week Ahead: Highlights Include FOMC, BOC And OPEC",2017-05-22 12:45:00+00:00,"submitted by shant movsesian (ransquawk) and rajan dhall msta weekly fx outlook: politics dominate yet again, as focus on comey testimony set to determine trump and usd fate.  fed minutes and opec meeting on the same day with the boc thrown in!  eur on the front foot and leading the pack as growth and inflation stats heighten tapering expectations, greenback flagging. late thursday, social media released a video suggesting the ex-fbi director denied any experience of interference to any ‘bureau’ investigations, but questioning was not inferred on donald trump.  as such, the president is not off the hook – far from it.  thin market conditions at the time produced some sharp usd moves to the upside, but have been all but reversed in full as us treasury yields remain on the heavy side. based on economic considerations, where the data has been tailing off of late, politics now ‘overlap’ as delays on tax reform will be seen to be exacerbated by the allegations on the head of state.  next week’s schedule picks up midweek, with the fed meeting minutes making for a volatile north american session at the very least.  the fomc are likely to see recent softness (in growth, inflation and wages) as transient – a popular word of late – so expectations over a june hike may have receded from 90%+ to 74%+, but the yield curve has been wilting in the mid curve to signal market focus beyond next month and 2017. of the data releases seen, friday’s q1 gdp seconding reading is standout, along with real consumer spending and the price index. durable goods are also out at this time, with q1 corporate profits also noteworthy.  the day before we get the latest trade data, with housing data and the markit pmis set to be ‘lost’ in the trump and fed circumstance. for now, usd/jpy has tested some key levels and rebuffed them, with 114.50 holding on the upside, while pre-110.00 bids set the base after the recovery through 111.00.  we see little prospect of a retest on the upper levels in the current climate, so it is not hard to see the rationale behind the near-term resistance ahead of 112.00. usd/cad has also been confined to some relatively narrow ranges in the last few days, with the rejection of the 1.3800+ resistance levels we highlighted, largely down to exhaustion more than anything else. yes, there are plenty of reasons to stay cautious on canada, with the overhang of nafta renegotiations along with heavy oil prices – which have since recovered some – and the home capital group fiasco, but as we have seen in selling on uncertainty, there is clearly a limit, and we have gone past fair value levels, especially with some healthy data reads. inflation is the exception to this, as today’s release confirmed. core yoy cpi dipped back to 1.1% from 1.3% with the headline unchanged at 1.6%.  this is something the boc have consistently highlighted, in their seemingly perennial cautiousness, but this has been mirrored by the rbnz and to a lesser degree the rba. the canadian central bank meeting is on wednesday, so the volatility metrics are totting up (!), especially with opec scheduled to meet. oil traders are looking for the major producers to extend the existing output deal, with consistent opec rhetoric suggesting an agreement has been made in principle.  saudi arabia and russia have touted a 9 month extension to the current production levels, so this would be the minimum which would appease the market, with wti already struggling to reclaim the usd50.00 handle.  nb, monday is a canada day holiday. onto europe, and from a data perspective, there seems to be little which can deviate the market away from looking to a change in policy communication later in the year, perhaps next month? the rate of eur gains seen against the usd may suggest this to a degree, but a large part of the move has been usd related.  as such, barring any significant weakness in the pmi reports through the week and the german ifo survey on tuesday, we can assume the single currency will remain near or at the top of the ‘destination flow’ list; the strong current account status adding appeal also. this has been a major detractor for the pound over the years, but somewhat selectively so; coincidentally when brexit fears were at their peak.  this does not seem to be an issue at the moment though, with the data holding up well in the face of the uncertainty of life outside of the eu.  fears over the negotiations have also subsided to a significant degree, but eur/gbp is pushing higher to suggest the tide may be turning again. key trading partners germany have been a little more conciliatory than some of the other member states, but the uk are adamant that they will walk away with no deal if it proves unfavourable.  this would have hit gbp hard either side of the new year, but with the larger fund managers now looking at the uk with a positive light on a longer-term basis – as we suggested when cable was trading nearer to 1.2000 – the mood on the pound has changed, more so against the greenback. key levels in the spot rate now lie at 1.3060-70 to upside, which has been initially rejected, but 1.3170 (ish) is next up should we push through this.  eur/gbp is struggling ahead of the 0.8600, briefly piercing this level over wednesday and thursday, but through here could see a run up to 0.8700, though pre-0.8800 is where the stronger selling interest lies.  thursday next week sees the preliminary gdp for q1 (second reading), with business investment also one to watch.  boe head carney testifies on inflation and the economic outlook to the tsc on tuesday. for the antipodeans, there is only the q1 construction work done to look to in australia, but this is the first metric to be incorporated into the gdp stats. other than this, all eyes are on metals and the iron ore markets - demand from china ever a concern - which saw a modest relief recovery on friday.  copper is back above usd2.55 for now, having survived a test on the band of support seen from usd2.50 to usd2.45. in nz, the focus will be on the domestic budget, but there will be relatively little towards business policies, and looks skewed towards social investment – teaching to get a large chunk.  as such, there is unlikely to be much here to impact on the nzd, so broader risk sentiment and aud/nzd trade will dictate. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China Donald Trump Germany Markit Yield Curve Volatility Testimony Australia CPI Market Conditions Copper Saudi Arabia recovery BOE OPEC RANSquawk,1

1738,Co-Inventor Of VIX Warns Low Volatility Is Not New Normal,2017-05-18 23:01:00+00:00,"""historically there seems to be a new group of people each time that underappreciates the very significant risks of being short volatility and wants to learn this expensive lesson ."" co-inventor of the vix index, sandy rattray is cio of man group, ceo of man ahl, and a member of the man executive committee, and he has a clear message for investors - he believes it is extremely unlikely that today’s low realized volatility represents a 'new normal' . in conversation with goldman sachs' allison nathan in her bi-weekly 'top of mind' letter, rattray warns ""the market is underpricing tail risk today."" asked about the current popularity of volatility-selling, rattray responds... across many previous cycles, volatility selling tends to be quite popular after long periods of relatively low volatility and unpopular just after volatility has spiked - the reverse of what would seem to be rational. so the fact that there’s lots of volatility selling at the moment isn’t particularly surprising in my view. historically there seems to be a new group of people each time that underappreciates the very significant risks of being short volatility and wants to learn this expensive lesson . in my view, shorting volatility should only comprise a relatively small part of a portfolio, and should have a clear risk-management process around it. if you don’t follow those two rules, then you could potentially end up in significant trouble. there is no question that these short-vol strategies can pose significant risk to individual investors pursuing them if they are not managed appropriately. that said, i’m not sure these volatility sellers are impacting the market any more than usual. the reality is the low levels of the vix are fairly consistent with low levels of realized volatility; s&p 500 30-day realized volatility is about 6.6 now, and the vix is about 10.6, versus a long-term spread between implied and realized volatility of about three to four points. so i don’t think we can blame much on volatility sellers themselves. i see them as playing their traditional role of keeping supply and demand for implied volatility in equilibrium. and in that context, rattray has some advice for traders and investors today... people often ask whether we have a new, lower normal in realized volatility. i believe with some conviction that we don’t. the very low-volatility environment today will end at some point, although it is very hard to forecast why and when that will happen. but we’ve had a fairly strong and continuous rally in equity markets around the world since 2009, and equities in a number of countries, particularly the us, don’t look terribly cheap today in my view. that does not mean that equities are going to correct in the near term. but it is unimaginable that equities don’t correct at some point. and echoing jpmorgan's kolanovich..., the focus is now back on central banks, with the probability of a june 14th hike rising after the fomc meeting yesterday (probability now at ~80%). a potential risk-off scenario could be a combination of macroeconomic data slowing, but the fed proceeding with normalization. neither a modest macro slowdown nor fed tightening is likely to tip over the market on its own. however, if it happens in the seasonally weak time period, and if it trips up some of the volatility sensitive strategies (e.g., volatility selling, volatility targeting, etc.) the increase of volatility could be more substantial. f or these reasons investors should closely monitor incoming macro data and paul tudor jones ... just as portfolio insurance caused the 1987 rout, he says, the new danger zone is the half-trillion dollars in risk parity funds. these funds aim to systematically spread risk equally across different asset classes by putting more money in lower volatility securities and less in those whose prices move more dramatically. because risk-parity funds have been scooping up equities of late as volatility hit historic lows, some market participants, jones included, believe they’ll be forced to dump them quickly in a stock tumble, exacerbating any decline. “risk parity,” jones told the goldman audience, “will be the hammer on the downside.” indeed, with all that low-vol leveraged, it wouldn't be the first time. rattray sees one group in particular as a potential catalyst... one concern is that many people choose to scale their positions by the level of realized volatility, which means there could be very large positions out there today with potentially significant leverage that might be vulnerable should volatility rise whether due to a tail risk event or other developments in the market. so it is important that investors have a plan for when the market environment changes. that plan could potentially involve a hedging strategy, a fund-management strategy, or it could come down to asset allocation or rebalancing—though rebalancing, of course, may exacerbate drawdowns . one size does not fit all here, so there is no one clear strategy to pursue. what is clear, rattray concludes, is that there will be a sell-off in risk assets at some point, and the investors who are unprepared are those who will potentially fare the worst. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",goldman sachs Goldman Sachs Volatility Paul Tudor Jones Equity Markets Central Banks ETC New Normal Reality,1
1766,"Evercore: If Markets Drop More, Don't Expect To Be Bailed Out By The Fed This Time",2017-05-18 14:17:00+00:00,"when we were discussing the self-reinforcing dynamics of vol-neutral funds yesterday, which may or may not continue selling today depending on what the vix does, we concluded that aside from the decision-making mechanics of systematic funds, the biggest question would be if the fed, or other central banks, do not do step in to prop up the market as they have on every other similar occasion in the past 8 years. would that imply that traders - be they ctas, risk-parity, or simply carbon-based - are finally on their own? according to a follow up note sent overnight by evercore isi's krishn guha, the answer is yes... at least for the first 10% of any upcoming market drop. as guha writes, ""with the us equity market sell-off intensifying wednesday afternoon, a number of clients have asked at what point the fed would ride to the rescue. our answer is that this time the cavalry is not coming — at least not unless we see something much larger — at least a 5 - 10 per cent type correction and maybe not immediately even then . clients need to rely on their own hedging and risk management strategies, not assume a public put that is anywhere near the current spot price. indeed fed officials might even welcome (within reason, it would be unwise to push this too far) the opportunity to disabuse the markets that such protection exists . somehow we doubt that after 8 years of propping up market, the fed will suddenly walk away, but who knows: maybe this time it is different. his full note below: if markets weaken further, don’t expect to be quickly bailed out by the fed with the us equity market sell-off intensifying wednesday afternoon, a number of clients have asked at what point the fed would ride to the rescue. our answer is that this time the cavalry is not coming — at least not unless we see something much larger — at least a 5 - 10 per cent type correction and maybe not immediately even then. clients need to rely on their own hedging and risk management strategies, not assume a public put that is anywhere near the current spot price. indeed fed officials might even welcome (within reason, it would be unwise to push this too far) the opportunity to disabuse the markets that such protection exists. to be very clear we are not forecasting a market correction; markets have shrugged off political woes before, the cushion from a weaker dollar and very low ten year yields provide some support for valuations, and a moderate but persistent step-up in volatility need not generate a large sell-off from here. we do however fear that there is a gap between market expectations and likely fed behavior that could intensify any correction that did take place at the point at which market participants realized that expectations of early fed support were not valid. in our view the right way to think about the so-called “fed put” is as follows. there is no direct fed put in the sense that even those policymakers who are sensitive to market developments do not view a given value of the equity market as a goal of policy or as a necessary condition for achieving the macro goals of policy (full employment and 2 per cent inflation). there is however an indirect and partial fed put in the sense that policymakers do respond to shocks — including from sudden large declines in the stock market — to the extent that these shocks threaten the achievement of its macro policy goals, and these actions tend to be stabilizing to markets. the fed macro put is time-varying with respect to equity market prices. first, the fed is more sensitive to equity market declines — as to any other form of negative shock — when it is pinned against the zero bound on rates as was the case for most of the past decade but is no longer strictly the case today. second, the fed is more sensitive to equity market declines when weakness is sustained, pervasive across asset classes (credit as well as equity) and geographies, and appears associated with real economic developments that threaten a marked deterioration in the outlook and balance of risks that could in turn be compounded by market weakness — as was the case in early 2016 but is not obviously the case today. as we wrote earlier this month we believe that the factors that caused the fed to appear skittish in 2015 and 2016 — weak and fragile global growth, extreme dollar strength and associated tightening in financial conditions, pronounced weakness in indicators of inflation expectations and the paucity of plausible upside risks — no longer apply in force today and the fed is therefore likely to appear more resolute, both with respect to soft patches in the data and any equity market sell-off. of course as with soft patches in the data this is not an absolute statement: a large enough and persistent enough decline in the equity market and associated loss of wealth and tightening of financial conditions would obviously have implications for the fed policy path. however, the fomc is likely to take a longer-range view than most market participants as to what the benchmark for this evaluation should be. if the s&p 500 fell another 5 per cent it would “only” be back where it was at the time of the december fomc meeting, since when the dollar has weakened appreciably; even a 10 per cent decline would “only” wipe out the gains since the day before the election. it is not obvious that either consumption or investment were highly sensitive to those moves on the way up, though it is certainly possible that they could be more sensitive on the way down. faced with a 5 - 10 per cent equity market decline that appeared driven by a correction of excessive valuations and fiscal policy hopes rather than a more troubling deepening of what the fed currently assesses to be transitory early year economic weakness, we think the committee might well still move forward with a june rate hike. the committee is not so far from the zero bound that it could prudently be too dismissive of an equity market correction and might at that point underline that subsequent tightening would be conditional on the economy continuing to evolve broadly in line with its expectations. but if the macro data on payrolls, unemployment, activity and inflation in the period running up to september indicated that the economy had firmed up following the soft patch in q1 with relatively little sign of drag from the equity market correction, a september hike, december start to balance sheet roll-off and some further hiking in 2018 would remain plausible — even if there would probably be a little less cumulative hiking over this period than would have been the case with a more robust equity market tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Risk Management Evercore Volatility Central Banks Unemployment,1
1801,What Happens Next? JPMorgan Has An Unpleasant Answer,2017-05-17 22:26:00+00:00,"having done the "" good cop"" routine earlier today , when it explained why a trump impeachment is ""very, very unlikely"" despite growing media speculation that vp mike pence may be preparing to step into the oval office, now it's jpmorgan's turn to play bad cop when previewing ""what comes next"" for both markets and politics. the reason for that is that according to jpm's adam crisafulli is that question is ""one of the market's problems"" because there simply ""isn't any quick action that would help to alter the narrative in washington"" resulting in a quick and painless resolution. here is the full note: what comes next? that question is one of the market’s problems. there isn’t any quick action that would help to alter the narrative in washington. congress could pass some legislation but there isn’t any consensus around the “big 3” pieces of the agenda. trump’s overseas trip (the first of his presidency), naming a credible and acceptable comey replacement (could happen within days), and publication of the wh f18 budget (due early next week) will help change the conversation somewhat but the russia/fbi headlines are unlikely to abate anytime soon (the conversation around impeachment is very, very premature – see earlier ). the month of may has been pretty quiet on the news front but that will change next week. of all the events scheduled for the week of 5/22, the most important will likely be the flash pmis on wed (the first major eco data point for the month of may), the fomc minutes on wednesday (given the importance fed policy will play in tsy yields). as a reminder, wednesday will be a critical day for another reason: that's when james comey is scheduled to testify . in other words, the selloff that started today - driven largely by political fears and uncertainty - may get some resolution only a week from today, when depending on what comey says, the dc scandal may blow over at least partially... or alternatively could get much worse. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",headlines FBI,1
1898,"Goldman Turns Less Confident On June, September Rate Hikes",2017-05-16 14:03:00+00:00,"following disappointing cpi prints for two months in a row, even such stalwart believers in the fed's tightening cycle as goldman sachs (recall hatzius warned recently that the fed may need to ""shock"" markets to tighten monetary conditions in light of the s&p relentless grind higher despite rising rates) are suggesting that the fed's rate hike trajectory for the rest of 2017 is suddenly in question. in a note released overnight, goldman chief economist hatzius writes that ""despite sharply weaker core inflation in the last two months, we continue to expect rate hikes in june and september followed by an announcement of balance sheet runoff in december, as well as a funds rate path well above the forwards in 2018 and beyond."" and whil he sayd that the firm has not ""made any changes to these forecasts because the negative inflation surprise has coincided with a roughly equivalent upside labor market surprise"" he adds that "" the risk to our near-term funds rate view is now slightly greater, largely because the range of plausible outcomes has widened. we have shaved our subjective odds of a june rate hike to 80%, from 90% earlier, and have also become a bit less confident in a september hike. if the outlook deteriorates significantly, the committee might simply delay any further tightening steps."" what does this mean for the sequence of proposed events between the fed's potential balance sheet reduction announcement and future rate hikes: according to hatzius it means that ""even a more modest deterioration could prompt the committee to pull forward the announcement of balance sheet runoff to the september meeting and delay the third 2017 rate hike until december. "" to provide further color on goldman's changing thinking, hatzius has expressed his thought in the now traditional self-q&a format as laid out below. q: what is the latest on core inflation? a: friday’s cpi report was another meaningful downside surprise. cumulatively, the year-on-year rate of core cpi inflation has fallen 0.33pp, from 2.22% in february to 1.89% in april. not all of this weakness will feed through into the core pce index, but we have lowered our q4 estimate to 1.8%, from 2.0% two months ago. q: have you made any changes to your baseline monetary policy call for 2017 in response to this surprise? a: no. our baseline forecast remains a hike in june, a hike in september, and a turn to balance sheet runoff to be announced in december. q: but won’t the fomc respond to the weaker inflation numbers by hiking less? a: not necessarily, because the downside inflation surprise has been accompanied by a significant upside labor market surprise. the unemployment rate has fallen by 0.3pp in the last two months and already stands 0.1pp below the fomc’s median yearend estimate of 4.5%. moreover, other indicators such as u6, the employment/population ratio, continuing unemployment claims, and payroll growth all tell a similar tale of ongoing sizable labor market improvement. on net, we have therefore reduced our unemployment rate forecast by 0.1pp in 2017 and 0.2pp in 2018, with risks that are probably still on the downside. q: so the surprises are of roughly equal magnitude. which one is more important? a: we view them as similarly important. a simple way to make this point is via a standard taylor rule framework. if we assume that each 1% increase in output equates to a 0.5pp decline in the unemployment rate, the original taylor rule implies that a 0.2pp reduction in inflation lowers the appropriate funds rate by 30bp while a 0.2pp reduction in the unemployment rate raises the appropriate funds rate by 20bp. in a modified “taylor 1999” rule, the impact of output and employment is doubled relative to the original version. this means that the impact of a 0.2pp reduction in unemployment rises from 20bp to 40bp. so if the committee puts some weight on both versions of the taylor rule, the surprises should have roughly offsetting effects. q: but doesn’t the weakness in core inflation also tell us that the structural unemployment rate might be lower? a: yes, in theory, but we would be cautious about this argument in practice. for one thing, more than half of the 0.33pp drop in the year-on-year core cpi from february to april was due to the cell phone services category. and almost all of this weakness resulted from methodological changes, which means that it provides no new information about structural unemployment. more generally, one should be cautious in “backing out” structural unemployment from the behavior of core cpi/pce inflation alone, given how poorly the phillips curve fits the data. this is especially true at a time when other, related indicators tell a different story. for example, our wage tracker stands at 3.0%, close to our 3¼% estimate of the pace consistent with full employment; unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector are up 2.8% year-on-year, above the 2% rate that is sustainable in the long term; and even the price signals are somewhat mixed, as the core final-demand producer price index has beaten expectations recently and now stands at 1.9% year-on-year, the highest level since 2014. q: so your baseline monetary policy view hasn’t changed. what about the confidence with which you hold this view? a: it has declined slightly because the conflicting signals on inflation and employment imply that the range of plausible outcomes is arguably greater than before. if the inflation weakness reverses, fed officials might accelerate the tightening process because of increased worry about labor market overheating. conversely, if job growth slows and the unemployment rate rebounds, they might pause the normalization. a wider range of outcomes implies that the probability of any given outcome is lower than before. q: have you changed your subjective probability of a hike in june? a: yes, we have shaved our subjective odds from 90% to 80%. a hike is still the most likely outcome by a sizable margin, partly because we have not yet seen much evidence that more dovish participants are pressing for a change in the committee’s strategy. (the exception is minneapolis fed president kashkari, who dissented against the march hike and has continued to press the case for continued accommodation.) that said, it has become more conceivable that developments between now and june 14—e.g. a large disappointment in the may employment report that calls into question some of the earlier progress—might persuade the committee to hold fire after all. (the may cpi is not released until the morning of the second day of the fomc meeting and is less likely to affect the decision.) q: how confident are you about september? a: although we currently do not provide explicit monetary policy probabilities beyond the next move in the funds rate, we have become slightly less confident about a september hike as well. if the outlook deteriorates significantly, the committee might just delay any further tightening steps. and even in the absence of a significant deterioration, a september hike is not assured, as we now see a slightly better chance than before that the committee pulls forward the announcement of balance sheet runoff to the september meeting and delays the third 2017 rate hike until december (although we emphasize that this is not our baseline view). q: why might they reverse the order? a: we see three potential reasons. first, our analysis suggests that the announcement of balance sheet adjustment is a smaller tightening step than a 25bp rate hike, and this is consistent with the subdued market response to the recent shift in the committee’s balance sheet guidance. if the committee is skittish about tightening too much at the september meeting but wants to retain the optionality of delivering three hikes in 2017, reversing the ordering of the third hike and balance sheet runoff might make sense. second, mid-september could be a time of high anxiety about the fiscal policy outlook . the federal government could partially shut down from october 1, the start of the new fiscal year, if spending legislation has not been passed by then . moreover, the debt limit is likely to become a constraint on treasury borrowing around the same time, probably in early october (this date is fluid and could come as soon as august but no later than october ). these deadlines are likely to be taken a bit more seriously this year than they have been over the last few years, as bipartisan support will be necessary for passage but could be difficult to achieve; policy differences between the trump administration and congressional democrats will be difficult to resolve, and concerns over the state of ongoing investigations into foreign influence in the recent election, if they continue, could make a resolution even more difficult. third, several fomc participants have recently hinted at a start to balance sheet runoff that could come earlier than the december meeting. for example, boston fed president rosengren said on may 10 that he favors a beginning of balance sheet runoff after the next funds rate hike, i.e. in september. moreover, chicago fed president evans gave an interesting response to a question about the balance sheet on may 12: “[m]arkets always want to know we’re going to do this at this day or time, but we like to think more broadly— that we’re likely to get something done by the end of the year, even if you’d like to know it’s going to be july or september or something like that.” this is an off-the-cuff response, but the “july or september” comment might hint at a higher probability of an earlier move than previously believed (although july is highly unlikely). q: what are the key things to watch? a: the next key piece of information is the may fomc minutes on may 24. we would expect the discussion of the funds rate outlook to be consistent with the march dot plot, based on the communications provided since the meeting. but the discussion of the balance sheet outlook could be more interesting, both from a timing perspective and with regard to any operational details of the upcoming transition. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",goldman sachs Goldman Sachs Unemployment Claims Monetary Policy CPI Unemployment Core CPI,1
1945,June: The Trifecta For Policy Error?,2017-05-15 20:21:00+00:00,"submitted by mark st.cyr, in about 30 days the federal reserve will hold its scheduled june (13-14) meeting of the fomc to either give a thumbs-up, or thumbs-down to increasing interest rates in earnest once again. the odds that the fed. will indeed raise again now stands at about 99%. in other words – it’s all but a near certainty. with that said, one can’t help but marvel at not only the “markets” sheer abandonment on volatility with such a near certainty on its doorstep. but rather, the only thing to rival it is the sheer arrogance being displayed by the fed. itself that such another increase is warranted as every data point to a self-professed “data dependent” consortium is not just flashing, but screaming danger with every passing day. e.g., b.e.a. q1 gdp 0.7% , atlanta fed. gdp now™ 0.2% , jpm cuts q1 gdp to just 0.3% , and more. in days of yore (i.e., ancient history circa 2016) whenever the odds of hiking approached anything like the levels they do now, the fed. would take to the media in any manner possible and try to supplant soothing tones of, “hush now little ones and not too worry…” as to make it evidently clear the fed. had no such intentions going into their next meeting. after all, as history has shown time, and time again, just the “idea” that a rate hike could be imminent sent the markets reeling needing for an ever incessant response of one fed. official after another to shout, “don’t worry! we’re here with ever more potent qe should the need arise!” i.e., this is why we now have such a thing being worthy of its own moniker. e.g., “bullard bottom.” today, the exact opposite is the case. not only are there not any soothing tones, but rather, there are tones emanating from what can only be described as an outwardly defiant, all seeing, ever proficient collection of “hawks are u.s.” for any and all questioning. as an example: in what can only be taken at first glance as a “wait, what?” moment. the new york fed. has concluded that the more than $500 trillion dollars (and rising – again!) of o.t.c. derivatives outstanding remain (wait for it…) “an important asset class.” for those of you having that “wait…what?” moment as you’re reading this and just can’t remember why your brain just froze from the absurdity of such a statement? that’s because “derivatives” was that phrase you recalled as the center for every reason which caused the great financial crash. (for those of you wanting more on this topic, i highly recommend this succinct breakdown by wolf richter of wolf street™ .) so why is the above important other than it’s “ticking time bomb” factor? (as if that isn’t enough.) no, the reason why it stands out for me is how it’s viewed by members of the fed. itself. i.e., “don’t worry, we got this!” and here’s the reasoning… if it’s now on the books (see above) openly stating its acknowledgment with its size and scope, along with, that the fed. itself sees it as an “important asset class?” that makes the case (or allows for it) that the fed. itself not only allowed, but rather, with eyes-wide-open helped facilitate its further ballooning. hence: if (or when) it “pops” the fed. has no one else to blame but itself (along with the potential hordes carrying “torches and pitchforks”) for they have now openly stated (again, and inserted it into their report) they not only knew of it, but rather, considered it as an “asset class.” e.g., giving it their blessing and endorsement. remember how that other all important “derivative” class of assets backed securities worked to facilitate the “great financial crash?” hint: cdo, mbs, cds, just to name a few? that too was another “we got this asset category.” feel better? the real issue that sits squarely in-front of the “markets” is the realization that the entire “reflation” trade may in fact be d.o.a. much like the legislation that was supposed to foster its existence to begin with. let me put it this way since we’re talking about “derivatives” and their potential for highly correlated monetary wealth destruction vehicles. the “reflation” trade that is now omnipresent in the “markets” which has facilitated the non-stop rocket-ship ride since the election of donald trump is nothing more than a “derivative” vehicle (or expression) of the underlying legislation that was to be its foundation or “backing asset.” e.g. signed into law legislation. in other words – if the legislation (i.e., tax cuts, obamacare repeal, et cetera) don’t become signed into law legislation amounting to precisely what the “value” of those cuts and more represented (i.e. $1 trillion in infrastructure, obamacare total repeal equivalents, massive corporate tax restructuring et cetera) the entire run up from nov 2016 to today becomes de facto null and void. e.g., the “derivatives” (as in the profits made) based on “the trade” become? hint: it’s not good. the only thing that could (or will) make matters worse was if the fed. had raised interest rates in anticipation. again, hint: not only have they raised, they’ve raised twice, and looking to raise for a third. all into further deteriorating economic data. to re-emphasize just how precarious the “market” now sits, below is a chart i feel puts it into perspective. to wit: (source) as one can see, that red rectangle represents the turmoil the “markets” had portrayed once the qe “iv tube” for all monetary woes was removed. again, not only did the “market” suddenly halt its ever-ascending journey, but it suddenly produced ever-increasing bouts of near-death experiences needing ever the more dovish tones from the revolving cast of fed. speakers hitting the media in ways that would make a kardashian envious. again, for i can’t mention this enough, right before the election in october 2016 the economy was on such shaky footing (and as the “markets” were rolling over once again) the chair of the federal reserve gave what i call her most contradictory speech when juxtaposed to today’s raising into weakness stating (paraphrasing): running a “high pressure” monetary policy may be the only way to heal the damage still residing within the economy via the crisis. an “ultra-dovish” insinuation if ever there was one. and yet, as the above shows, just 30 days later with the victory results of donald trump now into the books the fed. morphed into “hawks are u.s.” and have been ever since. i made note of this and was subsequently mocked via the mainstream business/financial media as something that “ain’t gonna happen” using the prior 2 years as evidence. i.e., directly after the meeting most analysis was, “they’ll probably not raise again till mid year, if then.” then, all the jawboning for more began in earnest via one fed. official after another including “balance sheet reduction.” then march happened, and now june is about too. here’s what i wrote in dec. of that week. to wit: “i implore you not to solely take my word, but to watch the presser for yourself and draw your own conclusions . i believe it’s one of the most forceful expressions made, or conveyed by the federal reserve that it may in fact act aggressively via monetary policy should it decide – it (“it” being the fed.) seems fit. i.e., the implications seemingly being sent are that they’ll decide what a “good” economy is – fiscal implications be damned. now is where “fiscal implications be damned” might be far more relevant than the fed. (as well as “markets”) ever imagined prior. the reasoning? all that “fiscal” seems to now be damned to not seeing the light of day as far as 2017 may be concerned. and that’s something i feel the fed. hadn’t calculated into their conclusions. (never-mind the “markets”) after all, with both the house, senate, topped with a president all controlled by the same political party; how would legislation not be passed swiftly? (although many others wonder that exact same thing, but i digress.) however, with that said, the economy was/is in no shape (just using the “data” we’re all told influences a supposed “data dependent” fed.) for incessant hawkish jawboning followed up by raising twice within 90 days. again: all while arguing (and allowing the inclinations to be held via the futures fund) that indeed the fed. is “hell-bent” on raising once again – in june! that would be 3 raises in all but 6 months with balance sheet reduction arguments still front and center in fed. communications when speaking in open forums. are you beginning to see the implications for “policy error” more clearly? i’m sorry to keep repeating, but it’s something which can not be repeated or stressed enough: with further deteriorating gdp and other metrics, along with no fiscal stimulus possibly seeing the light of day (meaning actually signed into law) for the rest of 2017, along with a potential government shutdown and more. june is now to be considered (as via the fed. not saying or refuting anything to the contrary) a done deal? and a prudent one at that? oh, and for those who may want even further examples for contemplation? here’s just one of the items that can be classified under “and more.” hint: china . but not too worry, for if you listen to current fed. officials and their assessment of global economic conditions, you know, where the “reflation” trade is the “derivative” of the underlying asset of passed legislation (which has gone from “passed” to all but doa) that the entire recent run up is based on? “they’ve got this!” just like they’ve got those other “derivatives” under their watchful eye. so june is now a shoe-in. feel better? perhaps that's why traders are starting to bet against the fed...

1994,What Do Rate Hikes Have To Do With Crashing Libor-OIS Spreads?,2017-05-15 00:04:00+00:00,"one of the more perplexing moves in recent weeks has been the rapid collapse in the libor-ois spread, traditionally a signal of bank credit risk, which has confused many rates traders due to contradictory signal it is sending in a world in which the fed is supposedly tightening. as we pointed out last friday , one probable explanation for this is the gusher of bank funding availability that the world's central banks (and even more so china) has unleashed. nowhere is that more evident than in the total decoupling between ""easing"" financial conditions, and ""tightening"" monetary policy. ... something which goldman itself pointed last week , when it remarked that its financial conditions index was the 'easiest' it has been in 2 years. furthermore, another potential explanation for the plunge in the spread emerged two weeks ago , when db's rates strategists suggested that it could be a function of japan's sudden revulsion toward us paper, and especially hedged treasury exposure, which deutsche pointed out resulted in a sharp tightening in the jpy cross-currency basis, which in turn compressed libor-ois. now, in a follow up note, deutsche picks up where it left off at the end of april, and highlights what we documented last week, namely that since peaking last september at 44bps, 3m libor-ois has collapsed each time the market got excited about higher rates. in fact, whenever the fed funds implied probability of a rate hike jumped just prior to an upcoming fomc meeting, a drastic narrowing of libor-ois ensued. so the question then is what do rate hikes have to do with libor-ois spreads? according to deutsche bank, the simple answer is that all signs point to the problem being there is weak demand for short-term unsecured borrowing. as short rates increase, banks have little reason to pay up for short-term funding when they can just term out their debt. the yield curve remains very flat, and demand for corporate debt seems ever insatiable. although there is still plenty of activity in the commercial paper market, banks are issuing opportunistically only at rates favorable to them. this week, the rate on a 90-day aa financial cp was 1.06%, virtually unchanged since after the march hike . at the same time, db notes that cash has been trickling back into prime money market funds. the spread between prime institutional fund yields and government institutional fund yields, although smaller than at the beginning of the year, remains very attractive at 30 bps currently. of note, six months after money market reforms and exactly zero funds (that we know of) had dropped below a $1 nav, money market investors are venturing back into prime funds for better returns on their cash. in may, prime money funds saw total assets rise above $400bn for the first time since october. with these dynamics in mind, a number of things would have to happen to reverse the tightening in libor-ois. in both these scenarios, bank issuers might bring some of their funding back to the front end, which should drive up cp rates and consequently libor. another possibility is if bills cheapen, perhaps driven by an increase in net supply, government money funds could become attractive to investors again and some of their assets might come back from prime funds. this in turn reduces the pool of cash looking to invest in commercial paper, which also drives up their rates. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China LIBOR Commercial Paper Japan Yield Curve Monetary Policy Central Banks Deutsche Bank,1
2055,"Trader Warns, The Fed Is Blinkered, ""Times Are A-Changin'""",2017-05-12 20:02:00+00:00,"having hiked rates into rising inflation and slumping economic growth in march (the weakest quarterly growth for a rate hike period since 1980), and continuing to proclaim a victorious normalization looms - despite collapsing economic data (except payrolls), it seems an auto-pilot fed is much more set on hiking rates than the market believes. somehow believing that storing up short-end ammo for when they are forced by maturation to shrink the balance sheet, the fed's trajectory is changing fast from the status quo of the last decade or so and as former fx trader and fund manager bloomberg's richard breslow, warns ""keep your eyes wide, cause times are a-changin'."" stockholm syndrome gets too much of a free pass. it’s become trivialized by overuse in tawdry crime dramas. but it really is an insidious condition that both weakens the soul and enables the perpetrators. in a world where it’s been all right to resist, it’s the antithesis of impetus for change and a destroyer of animal spirits. if there’s one thing that continues to characterize and dominate traders’ behavior it’s an intractable belief that economies, market structure and investing paradigms are no longer capable of evolving, let alone improving. but change is inevitable, as long as the prisoner isn’t killed off first. it’s deeply ironic, and a measure of just how intrusive central banks have become in the functioning, and very essence of markets that it’s taking all the persuasive powers of central bank communication to begin the process. no bond vigilantes here, traders are just too cowed. investors still think they understand the reaction function of monetary policy makers better than they do. careful with this one. it’ll take time, but whether it’s the fed, or even the ecb, eventually they will convince yield hunters that there might be much better levels to get in. i thought yesterday’s price response to a minuscule setback in the s&p 500 was telling. treasuries turned around, safe havens went bid, the dollar blinked. i guarantee that not a single fomc voter gave a second of thought to rewriting their next speech on rate hikes and balance-sheet reduction. markets have been in an absolute tizzy over the china/commodity nexus. china is tightening. how can they justify this when the shanghai composite is falling? they’ll crater everything, the global commodity complex will collapse bringing down producer economies around the world and inflation targets will become impossible dreams. it’s made for a great story. it’s also nonsense. china’s tightening because they have macro-prudential issues within their own economy to deal with. they had the first quarter outperformance to give them rope to play with. they aren’t trying to tank the economy. they’re taking advantage of the overshoot to deal with systemic issues. their responsible behavior is being portrayed as out of control because investors have come to take on faith that financial conditions indexes are the only measure of happiness. commodity traders who got burned the last two months should reflect on the ongoing efficacy of leveraging up to front-run chinese buying. and perhaps spend more time on fundamentals . by the way, the bloomberg commodity index is having a great finish to the week and left behind a significant technical low to lean on if you are bullish. and for that matter, the shanghai composite didn’t end up too shabbily either. it’s trying to break above the trend line defining the selloff of the last month. but importantly, it’s been commodities leading equities, not the other way around. it’s been a winning strategy to assume that nothing will ever change . but when even a hardliner like german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is quoted as telling spiegel magazine, “there’s no way of forming a community of states of different strengths without a certain equalization,” there may be rewards in keeping an open mind. just what do investors think will happen when the stock and flow of the fed balance sheet starts to tumble... tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China Vigilantes Monetary Policy Central Banks Bond,1
2131,Betting Against A June Rate Hike? Something's Going On,2017-05-11 16:49:00+00:00,"we noted yesterday that the recent trend of increased volumes into eurodollar future out-months was 'odd' ... but the sudden surge in interest in eurodollar calls (vs puts) suggests more than just a few prop bets are being placed on the fact that the fed does not hike rates in june . as bloomberg notes, preliminary futures open interest data for wednesday shows steep increases in several jun17 eurodollar call strikes, consistent with view that fed won't hike in june amid tightening fra/ois spread. however, these options bets have largely gone unnoticed as futures-market-implied odds (which the majority of investors are shown) of a june hike have been steady at around 80% for a week. a second consecutive drop in 3-month dollar libor setting wednesday prompted a flurry of dovish fed bets and waves of buying across jun17 eurodollar futures. and furthermore, the fed fund futures curve has flattened dramatically - signalling lost faith in the fed's hiking trajectory... and while these bets are being placed - against a june rate hike, the libor-ois spread - traditionally a signal of bank credit risk, has collapsed back to historic norms . one probable explanation for this is the gusher of bank funding availability that the world's central banks (and even more so china) has unleashed. nowhere is that more evident than in the total decoupling between ""easing"" financial conditions, and ""tightening"" monetary policy... despite two rate hikes, goldman's financial conditions index has improived to its 'easiest' in 8 months - thanks to the world's policy-makers fungible money spigot to keep the dream of reflation alive (as evidenced in the chart above by the s&p 500). this means, according to bloomberg's mark cudmore, that the fed’s room to tighten is being underappreciated. the market adjustment, when it comes, will be felt more in the front end than the long end of the u.s. rates curve. rates markets are only pricing one-and-a-half more hikes in 2017. that seems reasonable in the blinkered context that inflation shows little sign of accelerating out of control. however, monetary policy analysis needs to be updated. amid an excess of global liquidity, inflation is being dominated by macro factors. commodity prices and technological innovations, rather than marginal short-term interest rate adjustments, are top-most in people’s minds. the last two fed rate hikes had no sustained tightening impact. in fact, financial conditions in the u.s. are the loosest they have been in almost three years, and approaching the extreme of the historical range going back 27 years. this suggests that the fed has plenty of room to tighten policy. why wouldn’t they take steps to normalize while they can get away with it? ignoring the fact that this yet again argues for a rethink of inflation targeting and using short-term interest rates as the primary policy tool, it’s important investors don’t misinterpret the rationale and implications of any tightening. the next fed moves won’t be driven by accelerating growth or runaway inflation, so the yield curve shouldn’t steepen . but a subsequently flatter yield curve shouldn’t be read as signifying a policy misstep. this is just the way of the future. there is extremely abundant liquidity globally due to the expansion of central bank balance sheets. while that’s the case, old economic analysis frameworks are outdated and inadequate. which confirms what morgan stanley wrote, along with record high stocks, credit spreads at the tights since 2014, the broad dollar index continuing to hold little changed about 3% below the high hit in december, and longer-end yields remaining slightly lower year to date, historically low volatility across asset classes adds to a picture of very easy broad financial conditions. so does all the money in the short end helping keep cp yields and libor lower as fed funds rate expectations have been moving up . so the capitulation in pricing of a future reversal in the persistent libor-ois tightening trend in the past few months accelerated and had a large impact on swap spreads on top of more swapped issuance of corporate bonds by banks. the spot libor-ois spread fell another 0 7 by to 14 bp, another low since before the first fed rate hike in 2015 after a 20 by drop in the past two months. that's not far now from the 9bp average from 2004 through the first half of 2007 (before getting as high as 364bp on october 10. 2008. maybe the single most extreme financial market price of the whole crisis). the forward libor-ois spread to june fell to 14.8bp. down from 15.8bp tuesday and 19.4bp friday mostly giving up on any near-term widening. the libor part of that was reflected in the jun 17 eurodollar futures contract rallying 2bp to 1.265%, down from 1.305% friday, even as jul 17 fed funds futures held steady at 1.11%. pricing an 83% chance of a june rate hike , up from 1.095% friday. never mind seeing a transmission from the fed funds rate to broad financial conditions in impacts on stocks, long-end yields, the dollar. et al., if higher fed funds rate expectations struggle to even get traction in raising short-term market interest rates. which translated into english implies the fed has lost control of the transmission mechanism of its operations , just as we noted goldman concerned about , which brings up another question: if the fed retains its ability to steer financial conditions, why have financial conditions eased recently despite ongoing hikes ?

2164,"Goldman Asks If Yellen Has Lost Control Of The Market, Warns Of Fed ""Policy Shock""",2017-05-11 01:35:00+00:00,"just hours after the fed's march ""dovish"" rate hike, when stocks paradoxically surged to all time highs and yields tumbled, goldman found something strange : ""surprisingly, financial markets took the meeting as a large dovish surprise—the third-largest at an fomc meeting since 2000 outside the financial crisis, based on the co-movement of different asset prices."" even more surprising is that according to goldman, its financial conditions index, ""eased sharply, by the equivalent of almost one full cut in the federal funds rate."" in other words, the fed's 0.25% rate hike had the same effect as a 0.25% race cut ! goldman's jan hatzius then went on to note that this was "" almost certainly not "" the desired outcome that janet yellen had been going after, and that markets had in fact misread the fed's tightening intentions. the goldman chief economist then asked rhetorically ""how will the committee respond to this potentially undesired move"" and answered "" at the margin, it will likely make them more inclined to tighten policy. using today’s estimated close, our fci impulse model now implies a boost of about ½pp to real gdp growth in 2017, from a starting point of roughly full employment and inflation close to the target . so further fci easing implies at least some risk of economic overheating—which in turn would increase the risk of recession further down the road . we expect the committee to lean against such an easing over time."" nearly two months later, with stocks at new all time highs, and financial conditions even easier than they were the first time goldman warned that the market had misread the fed's intentions, goldman goes back to this most sensitive of topics and writes that despite two rate hikes and indications of impending balance sheet runoff, financial conditions have continued to ease over the past six months. despite two rate hikes and indications of impending balance sheet runoff, financial conditions have continued to loosen in recent months. our financial conditions index is now about 50bp below its november 2016 average and near the easiest levels of the past two years. hatzius then asks if - in not so many words - the fed has lost control of the market, or if the fed will simply have to punish the market with a ""monetary policy shock"" to make it clear that the fed demands tighter conditions to delay the next recession. to wit: does this mean that 1) monetary policy has lost its ability to affect financial conditions or 2) fed officials just need to deliver more rate hikes if they want to bring about an fci tightening? according to hatzius, "" the answer is 2) "" and that the fed has not lost control of the market just yet. which brings up another question: if the fed retains its ability to steer financial conditions, why have financial conditions eased recently despite ongoing hikes ? the answer is that fed policy—especially fed policy communicated around fomc meetings—only accounts for a relatively small part of the ups and downs of financial conditions. and other developments such as the sharp pickup in global growth have been helpful for us financial conditions by boosting risk assets while keeping the us dollar from appreciating sharply in response to higher short-term interest rates. while it is difficult to say whether future non-monetary policy shocks will be positive or negative for us financial conditions, our finding that the impact of fed policy on financial conditions remains (at least) similar to the longer-term average suggests that fed officials should be able to achieve their goals for financial conditions by moving the funds rate if they try hard enough. fed policy retains sizable impact what goldman really meant to say is that the fed's 50 bps in rate hikes since december have been drowned and offset by the trillions in new credit created out of china. that credit expansion is now ending however, and china's credit impulse has tumbled into negative territory (but that's a different topic). going back to goldman, hatzius adds that ""we find that the sensitivity of financial conditions to monetary policy shocks has been quite high recently , at least when we identify these shocks using bond market moves around fomc meetings. this suggests that the easing of financial conditions is due to other factors, most obviously the improved global environment, not reduced traction of monetary policy."" what form will this monetary tightening ""shock"" take place?

2327,"Trader On Macron Risk-Off - ""Today's Get Rich Quick Scheme Didn't Work Out So Great""",2017-05-08 13:58:00+00:00,"well today’s get rich quick scheme didn’t work out so great , writes former fx trader and fund manager rich breslow. it turns out that more than a few traders had the idea that they’d go with the huge macron poll lead and superior debate performance and place a little weekend flutter . after all, not that many other people may have noticed. but whether or not the euro, bund yields and the like behaved as hoped on macron’s win isn’t really dispositive of anything. put it all down to noise. this is noise of a good sort. markets didn’t gap and die, like they’ve been doing. if you think this election was an unmitigated positive for things europe then there’s still plenty of time to jump in. if you just know that nothing ever changes and the social and economic ills live on, well most of the first round bounce is still there to be faded. counter-intuitively, the post-election wave of implied volatility selling is probably a mistake. yes, the digital risk of a black-swan event, such as it was made out to be, is gone, but that was more an excuse for people to not trade. if the near or intermediate direction of asset prices is to be decided by economic numbers and projected central bank policy, that’s something you should be comfortable positioning for. clearing the decks actually makes the potential for trends to emerge greater, not lesser. the number one question in your mind should be, what, if anything, this means for ecb policy? do you really think this could push them to be explicitly more hawkish? will they test the waters with speeches full of veiled hints? one thing you know for sure, the market will be hyper-sensitive to anything smacking of tapering. and react accordingly. they want to believe. but don’t get too invested following the germans. we’ve heard what they think. watch peter praet for trial balloons. see if president mario draghi has even a soupcon of different body language when he speaks on wednesday. and don’t fall into a mindset where you mentally fade every fed comment and blow out of proportion every ecb one. the fomc also has a plan that they’d like to stick to. so during this thought period what to watch? the euro back above 1.10 would be impressive. below 1.0850, a clear failure. if you are micro-managing, use 1.0960 as a super short-term pivot of sentiment. the euro isn’t only down against the dollar and yen. it’s down versus most of eastern europe. this is actually a healthy sign for the region more broadly, so be careful misreading this as a warning sign. it’s bullish in the grand scheme of things. if it lasts. if the ecb has any plans to be less generous, then bund yields don’t belong here. until they get motoring above 50 basis points in yield, there’s something wrong with the blast-off scenario. back above today’s high and traders might just try to see if they can gun for it. if yields fall back below 30 basis points you won’t be able to get the sound of robert preston singing “ya got trouble” out of your head. european equities have been on a tear. momentum here is the key. it could very well be that it’s as simple as watching how they trade around today’s highs. they look great, but can’t really afford any setbacks. and, because i can’t resist, watch gold at 1220 for a great pivot level on general world view. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Eastern Europe Volatility Yen,1
2427,"Former Fed Governor Warsh Asks ""What Could Possibly Go Wrong"", Answers",2017-05-05 19:08:00+00:00,"former fed governor kevin warsh, one of the most outspoken and critical members of the fed's extended family by far, lashed out at the prevailing groupthink that has permeated the federal reserve in a speech delivered moments ago at the hoover fed conference titled ""the battle of ideas"", in which among other things he explained that the fed has no real strategy on policy normalization, asked ""what could possibly go wrong"" and, unlike all his former colleagues, provided an honest answer. here are some select excerpts from his speech: according to popular lore, the valley finds itself in the middle of long epoch of prosperity. and we are assured this is a sustainable, durable equilibrium. what could possibly go wrong ? that is the central question central bankers should be asking. (tail risks run in both directions. a subject for another day is ‘ what could possibly go right’? the more material constraint on further economic expansion is on the productive side of the economy. if a pro-growth reform agenda were adopted across a range of macroeconomic policies, higher labor and capital supply into the real economy would cause economic growth to track substantially above fed forecasts.) on fake markets and the death of price formation: we should allow asset prices to be an independent source of economic insight and discipline. on peak groupthink leading fed officials are confidently predicting a benign external environment for the next several years: steady growth, stable inflation, and financial assets trading at fair values. policymakers have all but proclaimed their monetary mission accomplished, their employment and inflation targets largely achieved. the dot forecasts from members of the fomc are nearly on top of each other. the last time i recall such uniformity of opinion—among central bankers, academics, and market pros-- was just over 10 years ago. on why he is worried: maybe the scars of the last crisis burden me with unnecessary worry. maybe the levers of macroeconomic policy are sufficiently improved such that business, economic, credit, and financial cycles are an artifact of history . maybe the economy gets another decade of moderate growth and inflation. on the fed's faulty forecasts: my crystal ball is scarcely perfect. but neither is the fed’s . the most important forecaster trait is humility.  the most important forecaster trait is humility. the most important forecasting measure is the confidence interval, not the point estimate. the most common forecasting error is groupthink. the best forecasting fix is assemble a humble, independent, diverse, intellectually rigorous, and cohesive group. the fed has a lot riding on its outlook, and its institutional inclinations give me pause. policymakers should evaluate the tail risks of their forecasts with more care than the central tendency. and scrupulously judge their ability to respond in less likely, but more disruptive scenarios. on the need to reorganize the fed: changes are in order to how the fed organizes itself, conducts its business, deliberates policy choices, and makes its monetary policy decisions . in short, deliberations should be more robust, and decisions less constrained. the existing governance structure reinforces a groupthink of the guild. it places the fed at considerable institutional risk when the next crisis strikes. and it makes the next crisis more likely to be more harmful to the economy. a list of what should not be done: his troubling conclusion: when the next shock strikes, the fed is unlikely to have conventional or unconventional armaments in sufficient supply. it is safe to say that none of these recommendations will be adopted by the career economists at the fed. * * * but for us, the punchline was the following: warsh's admission that despite the daily rhetoric and constant jawboning, the fed really has no exit policy; i am confused by the fed’s ‘normalization’ strategy in monetary policy. its preferred sequencing of rate increases and balance sheet reductions differ markedly from what was agreed when we conceived qe in the ’war room’ amid the crisis. there might be good reason. but, the transmission mechanisms of rate changes and balance sheet adjustments are markedly different than projected. so too are the distributional effects. this merits a more robust public explanation. * * * full speech below ( link ) tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",None Federal Reserve Volatility Monetary Policy Fed Governor Kevin Warsh Warsh,1
2442,The Triumph Of Hope Over Experience,2017-05-05 14:13:00+00:00,"authored by pater tenebrarum via acting-man.com, on wednesday the socialist central planning agency that has bedeviled the market economy for more than a century held one of its regular meetings.  thereafter it informed us about its reading of the bird entrails via statement (one could call this a verbose form of groping in the dark). modern economic forecasting rituals. a number of people have wondered why the fed seems so uncommonly eager all of a sudden to keep hiking rates in spite of economic data in q1 indicating surprising weakness in   economic output (of course they once again didn’t hike rates, this time). we have long suspected that the real reason for the urge to hike is to accumulate “ammunition” for the next downturn. after all, it really shouldn’t make much of a difference where the federal funds rate is; the federal funds market is basically dead anyway, and the fed continues to refrain from shrinking its balance sheet (i.e., bank reserves will remain elevated, and the fed won’t actively exert pressure on money supply growth). then again, the statement is actually in keeping with the orthodox (largely keynesian) view of the economy and the central bank’s presumed tasks. there is actually no need to take it at anything but face value. the complete statement can be seen here , but we want to focus on one particular excerpt – which follows an enumeration of various data points in paragraph one: “consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.” (emphasis added) so why are they saying that? here is a snapshot of the data points that are held to be important to the fed – click to enlarge. if we look superficially at the unemployment rate and the pce deflator, then the fed has every reason to hike rates. its mandated targets have been reached and short term rates remain historically extremely low. the only seeming fly in the ointment is the “transitory” weakness in gdp. as far as we can tell, there is a consensus on this point that was mentioned in nearly every mainstream financial press article reporting on the fomc statement. here is an example : “first-quarter growth grew at a weak 0.7 percent, but economists expect a bounce back and some see growth over 3 percent.” of course, economists always expect a “bounce-back”  after a weak quarter –  except at the actual bottoms of recessions, which is pretty much the only time when the consensus becomes negative. in essence, such statements are completely meaningless, because that’s what they will say every time. given continuous monetary inflation, gdp will of course “grow”  75% of the time or more (we are just making a rough guess here, this is about the principle rather than a precise figure). predicting a “bounce-back” after a weak quarter is therefore the statistically safest forecast – this is very similar to bullish stock market forecasts being being correct around 67% of the time on average. these people are merely guessing of course, just as the members of the fomc are guessing. in reality, none of them have the foggiest idea of what is going to happen. if that were not the case, the “consensus” and/or the fed would correctly forecast every major turning point – but they have yet to forecast even a single one . if one wants to know when a serious economic downturn is about to begin, it is probably better pick a few housewives at random and ask them – chances are they will beat these experts at the forecasting game. consider also all the “excellent data” shown above (ex gdp), which the experts tend to extrapolate to eternity. did these data look any less excellent at the previous major business cycle peaks? of course not – in fact, they often look even better. the reason why we even mention all of this is that there is an additional twist to the “q1 weakness” story.  in several reports it was asserted that the fed is looking beyond this datum, because the “first quarter is always weak, and everybody knows it”. the reason, so the story goes, are seasonal adjustment kinks which appear to be operative since 2013 and have yet to be ironed out (so  it’s not the “bad weather” after all! that was the story told in previous years as we recall…). so if everybody knows it, surely the consensus was looking for a very weak q1 from the outset, right? not really. here is the evolution of the atlanta fed’s q1 gdp now model, including the consensus range. in spite of what “everybody knows”, the blue chip consensus on q1 gdp growth at the beginning of the quarter ranged from 1.9% to 2.7%. but they all know what’s going to happen next! – click to enlarge. perhaps we should also mention that one of the two data series the fomc is fixated on, namely  the unemployment rate, is not without its problems at present. the labor force participation rate is currently at a level last seen in 1978, after a free-fall that has by now lasted 18 years. employment has indeed improved in recent years, but the official u3 unemployment rate is flawed in a great many respects (participation is just one). labor force participation rate – back at 1978 levels – click to enlarge. now, we will admit, it is easily possible that the second quarter will turn out to be stronger than the first. gdp is such a malleable and imprecise (not to mention fundamentally useless) datum, that quarter-on-quarter guesses are like flipping coins. we are only talking about all of this because we were struck by how quickly a consensus has formed around the view expressed by the fomc. even so, it would not be worth mentioning any of this if not for the next several charts. we have shown some of these charts before, but we believe it is worth doing so again. these data strongly suggest that something more serious than a “transitory” slowdown in economic activity may be in the offing. for instance, the recent decline in credit growth, which did get a little bit of attention in the mainstream media a few weeks ago, continues – y/y bank lending growth rates are still hitting new lows. first, here is the most recent chart of the money ams again (adjusted money supply, essentially the narrow version of tms-2): money ams growth has gone all the way from a peak well above 16% y/y in november 2016 to the low single digits recently – a level last seen in 2007 – click to enlarge. the broad money supply tms-2 has followed suit, with its y/y growth rate falling to 6.12% recently, which is the lowest since october 2008. we include the growth rate in total bank lending again (at 4.73% from a recent peak at 8.12%) but have added the annual growth rate in commercial and industrial loans, which is updated more frequently. the latter data series shows that bank lending growth has continued to slow rather noticeably in recent weeks. c&i loan growth has now fallen from an interim peak of 13.43% to a mere 2.24% y/y as of late april. y/y growth of money tms-2, total bank loans & commercial and industrial loans. note the continued slowdown in c&i loans (purple line) – click to enlarge. and here are two more chart that should give everyone pause. both show the y/y growth rate in federal tax receipts. first a shorter term one: it is remarkable that federal tax receipts are slowing so dramatically with the stock market still near an all time high (usually asset bubbles tend to boost tax revenues noticeably). here is a longer term version of the same chart. the point of this is to show that this is a fairly reliable signal – since the mid 1960s the ratio between recession signals that were valid and those that weren’t was seven to three (the current decline is not included in this count). however, of the three false signals, one coincided with the 1987 stock market crash, and the other one with the s&l crisis about 18 months later. long term chart of the y/y growth rate in federal tax receipts. declines into negative territory are often a sign that the economy is about to step off a cliff – click to enlarge. all is probably not well. that may not become obvious just yet in the very near term, but if the trends depicted above continue, various bubble activities will get into severe trouble as the year progresses. it may finally be time to batten down the hatches. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",None Monetary Policy Federal Tax Money Supply Recession Unemployment Market Crash Market Conditions Reality,1
2450,Oil Fireworks Unsettle Global Markets Ahead Of Payrolls Report,2017-05-05 11:48:00+00:00,"with all eyes on crude, following last night's mini flash crash which sent wti lower by 3% from just above $45 to under $43 in under 10 minutes, equity markets, generally quiet overnight, have taken on a secondary importance ahead of today's key risk event, the april payrolls report ( full preview here ). in global equities, asian and european stocks are lower, while s&p futures are little changed. the main in the overnight session was oil's sudden slide below $45 a barrel for the first time since opec agreed to cut output in november. as noted earlier, in less than 10 minutes on friday, u.s. futures slumped more than $1 amid a surge in volume, launching a modest scramble into safe haven assets such as treasurys, yen and gold. they have collapsed 8.6 percent this week, erasing all gains since the organization of petroleum exporting countries signed a six-month deal in november to curb production and ease a global glut. things only began to stabilize when saudi arabia's opec chief did the usual jawboning routine, hitting the wires in european hours and saying there was a growing consensus among oil pumping countries that they needed to continue to ""rebalance"" the market. specifically, the saudi opec governor's comments that: ""a six-month extension (to production cuts) may be needed to rebalance the market, but the length of the extension is not firm yet."" which while nothing new, provided a floor to the overnight dump and a signal to btd. as a result of the plunge, which has since mostly recovered, the bloomberg commodity index slumped to lowest in a year, weighed by oil and iron ore. ""markets are losing faith that the global inventory glut will disappear on opec’s cuts,” said michael poulsen, an analyst at global risk management ltd. following the unexpected snap, stocks flinched both in asia and europe, catching investors that had been expecting to spend the day mostly looking ahead to u.s. jobs data and sunday's french elections, on the back foot. ""the whole commodity complex has been affected by this and it could have some pretty big implications if it continues for much longer,"" said saxo bank's head of fx strategy john hardy. ""if you look at global risk appetite, equities have been pretty quiet and that feeds into fx as well if carries on and there is a risk switch."" as reuters adds, oil wasn't the only commodity that suffered, with chinese iron ore futures falling almost 7% in shanghai after tumbling 8% on thursday. the canadian dollar, the australian dollar and russia's rouble - the world's commodity- sensitive currencies - were all sent spinning, falling respectively to 14-month, four-month and seven-week lows. today's key event is the april payrolls number. following that soft 98k reading in march (which was more than likely weather-related) the market consensus for today’s print is a more sturdy 190k number. db expects this rebound to be driven by two main factors. the first is initial jobless claims remaining near a roughly four-decade low and the second being that employee tax withholding receipts are growing at a very healthy rate, indicating a pick-up in income growth. it is worth adding though that while the adp print earlier this week was fairly solid the employment components from the two isms has revealed some softening so that might sound some caution. as always keep an eye on the other components of the employment report including unemployment (expected to nudge up one-tenth to 4.6%), average hourly earnings (+0.3% mom expected) and the participation rate. the report is due out at 8.30am. european shares declined and the dollar was mixed against its peers ahead of u.s. employment report. the stoxx 600 index’s fall tracked declines in much of asia and in u.s. futures. gold climbed from a seven-week low and iron ore fell for a third day. in asia, the shanghai composite index was down 0.8 percent at 3,103 after earlier dropping below 3,100. the gauge neared its lowest close this year s&p 500 futures were steady ahead of the u.s. monthly jobs report, with energy shares understandably in the spotlight as oil prices remained volatile after dropping below $45 a barrel for the first time since november. s&p 500 contracts expiring in june were little changed at 2,386 at 6:30 a.m. et. the benchmark has been moving in a tight range this week, despite relatively strong corporate results. contracts on the dow jones industrial average were steady at 20,857. the euro meanwhile touched six-months highs of almost $1.10 ahead of france's weekend election, in which polls now expect centrist emmanuel macron to convincingly beat right-wing and anti-euro rival marine le pen. the gap between french and german 10-year government borrowing costs also hit a six-month low and despite the dip on the day, european shares were heading for a healthy 1.2 percent rise for the week. the dollar and u.s. government bond yields had both been nudged lower by the commodity market worries. it is set to be the fourth weekly fall on the trot for the greenback which is now at its lowest since november. the yen and gold rose in tandem as investors took refuge in safe havens, though the latter remained on track for its biggest weekly decline in nearly six months on bets that u.s. interest rates will rise again in the coming months. a handful of bearish comments emerged overnight, such as hermes chief economist neil williams who said that ""i think the payrolls will be under consensus. it fits with my view that the u.s. is going to peak out at a far lower interest rate than markets expect. the fed's dot plots says 3 percent, but i'm going closer to 1.5 percent."" bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot top overnight news from bloomberg asia equity markets traded negative amid commodity weakness in which oil continued its sell-off, while the looming us nfp data also added to the subdued tone. asx 200 (-0.8%) was led lower by miners and energy names after metals remained weak and wti crude futures extended on yesterday's 5% drop amid oversupply concerns. however, telecoms outperformed as telstra shares surged after accc ruled the co. doesn't need to share its network infrastructure with competitors. shanghai comp. (-0.7%) and hang seng (-0.4%) also reflected the downbeat tone amid tighter liquidity by the pboc, after it refrained from open market operations which resulted to a cny 60bin net daily drain. finally, japan and south korea remained closed for children's day. pboc refrained from open market operations today, for a net injection of cny 10bin vs. prey. cny 70bin net injection last week. pboc set cny mid-point at 6.8884 (prey. 6.8957) top asian news european equities have kicked off the final trading session of the week in modest negative territory (eurostoxx 50 -0.1%) amid tentative trade ahead of nfp later today. in terms of sector specifics, energy names are the notable outperformers as european trade has seen a modest recovery in energy prices despite the market appearing to lose confidence in opec's ability to continue to prop up prices. elsewhere, european earnings have been on the light side today with markets pausing for breath ahead of nfp. similar rangebound price action has also been observed in fixed income markets with bunds trading in close proximity to recent losses seen in the wake of the fomc on wednesday. oats are also relatively stable ahead of this weekend's french election. top european news in currencies, focus early was on gbp with the conservatives cleaning up in local elections at the expense of their rivals ahead of next month's general election with prices moving ever closer towards 1.3000. usd/jpy continues to attract the bulk of us data driven trade, but we saw 113.00 holding firm on thursday before fading risk sentiment added to the pullback which now sees us trading in the low 112.00's. aud continues to edge lower, now sub 0.74, but momentum has been slowing. base metals and copper in particular have been the primary drag with dalion iron ore futures slipping yet again, and this in light of an rba strongly suggesting rates will stay on hold. in commodities, a bulk of the focus has been on energy markets with wti crude futures falling off a cliff overnight in extension of thursday's 4.8% losses. there was no fresh immediate catalyst for the decline but there are currently a multitude of bearish factors in the market, most notably; increasing cynicism about opec's ability to ease the global supply glut, increasing output from us shale producers, increasing production from libya and demand-side concerns. that said, european hours have seen a modest recovery as buyers have entered the market ahead of the touted support zone seen in wti at usd 44.00. elsewhere, the majority of commodities remained subdued with dalian iron futures down a further 6% in early trade to a near 4-month low, although gold found slight reprieve as the oil sell-off spurred safe-haven flows. looking at the day ahead, all eyes will be on the aforementioned us april employment report. also due out today is the march consumer credit reading for the us. away from the data both the eu’s juncker and tusk are scheduled to speak today while over at the fed it is a packed day for fedspeak with fischer (4.30pm bst), williams (5.45pm bst) and yellen (6.30pm bst) all speaking at separate. us event calendar central banks db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap the biggest news in the uk yesterday was that of prince philip who announced his retirement later this year at the age of 96 after seven decades of being at the queen's side. at this stage i can't imagine still writing research for another 53 years but over the last few weeks i've compiled a spreadsheet of the extra costs that having twins will entail over the coming years (and maybe decades) and i can only conclude that i might need to marry the queen myself to afford retirement. so here's to the early morning reid of 2070 where we'll probably still be explaining that bund yields are too low, us equities are overvalued, defaults remain structurally low and pondering why england haven't won the world cup for 104 years. back to the present and there's been a fascinating face-off in markets over the last 24 hours between tumbling commodity prices but rising bond yields. on a day when 10y bunds climbed +6.8bps to the highest yield in 5 and a bit weeks we saw wti oil slump -4.81%. it’s tumbled a further -2.99% this morning as well and at one stage went below $44/bbl for the first time since november last year. needless to say the moves over the last 24 hours has seen oil more than wipe out the post opec supply cut agreement gains (its currently at the lowest level since november 15th at $44.19/bbl). a few factors seem to be contributing to the move. wednesday’s weekly eia data provided further evidence of historically high crude stockpiles levels. increasing production out of libya is also contributing in addition to the shale production growth story in the us. there was also some chatter about brent and wti slicing through key support levels yesterday which only seemed to add fuel to fire. it’s not just oil which is having a rough time of late though as metals are also feeling the pain. iron ore tumbled -5.07% yesterday, copper fell -1.02%, aluminium -0.57% and nickel -2.33% with the soft china pmis in april following a soft q1 gdp print in the us being billed as the main justification for the move, while tighter liquidity conditions in china is also contributing with onshore money-market rates at two-year highs. gold (-0.81%) and silver (-0.89%) also fell for a second day post the fomc yesterday. indeed the broad crb commodity index closed down -1.88% last night and has now fallen 11 times in the last 14 trading days to the lowest level since april 2016. in terms of the move in bunds, the early rise for yields can be attributed to some catch-up to the treasury move following the fomc however there was some interesting ecb speak yesterday which also caught the bond market’s attention. specifically it was the comments from ecb chief economist peter praet who, on the topic of when a tightening in rates might follow the end of qe, said “we say ‘well past’ but this is a judgement which will be very much data dependent” and that “it can be long, it can be short”. the most important element of his speech however was his well highlighted flag that june is the meeting  where the ecb is likely to formally change its balance of risk assessment and possibly forward guidance. indeed praet said that “looking forward to our next monetary policy in june, we will be able to draw on a more expanded information set than is available today, organised around new projections and including an updated assessment of the distribution of risks surrounding the economic outlook”. ecb president draghi also spoke yesterday but his comments were a bit of a nonevent for markets. as well as the move for bunds, treasury yields edged up another 3.6bps to 2.355% and are now at the highest since april 10th. at the other end of the spectrum risk assets have proved to be incredibly  resilient to the selloff in commodities. despite the energy sector doing its best to drag the broader index lower the s&p 500 closed +0.06% last night and has now moved up or down by less than 0.20% for each of the last 7 sessions which ties the longest ever run of such narrow ranges according to bloomberg, set in 1972. us credit markets were similarly subdued with cdx ig fading into the close but still only closing 0.6bps wider. on the politics front, as expected the healthcare bill was voted on and was passed by house republicans by a small majority of 217-213 votes, and so scoring a first big legislative victory for president trump. the real test will now come in the senate however where the bill’s passage is far from certain to be passed. so these have been the key themes over the last 24 hours. a reminder that this sunday brings the second round of the french elections with markets pricing in a very very low probability of anything other than a macron victory which according to all the polls is fair enough. more immediate though is today's us payrolls number. following that soft 98k reading in march (which was more than likely weather-related) the market consensus for today’s print is a more sturdy 190k number while our us economists are a little bit above market at 200k. the team expect this rebound to be driven by two main factors. the first is initial jobless claims remaining near a roughly four-decade low and the second being that employee tax withholding receipts are growing at a very healthy rate, indicating a pick-up in income growth. it is worth adding though that while the adp print earlier this week was fairly solid the employment components from the two isms has revealed some softening so that might sound some caution. as always keep an eye on the other components of the employment report including unemployment (expected to nudge up one-tenth to 4.6%), average hourly earnings (+0.3% mom expected) and the participation rate. the report is due out at 1.30pm bst. before we get there, overnight in asia we’ve continued to see base metals remain under pressure and that, along with the move for oil, is weighing on equity bourses with the asx (-0.76%), hang seng (-1.07%) and shanghai comp (-0.85%) all in the red. markets in japan and south korea are closed. commodity sensitive currencies including the aussie dollar (-0.47%), norwegian krone (-0.42%) and canadian dollar (-0.27%) are also weaker in the early going. us equity index futures are also pointing towards a softer start. with regards to the economic data yesterday, also helping the bund move (and a strong session for european equities with the stoxx 600 firming +0.67%) was a slight upward revision to the services pmi for the euro area in april to 56.4 from 56.2, led by a big upward revision for germany to 55.4 from 54.7. france was revised down 1pt to 56.7 while data in italy (56.2 vs. 53.6 expected; 52.9 previously) was also a big upward surprise. over in the uk the services pmi also printed at a better than expected 55.8 which was an increase of 0.8pts. that helped to push the composite to 56.2 and the highest since december. over in the the us yesterday q1 non-farm productivity came in at a softer than expected -0.6% qoq (vs. -0.1% expected) which leaves through-year growth at just +1.1% yoy. meanwhile unit labour costs were reported as rising +3.0% qoq which was a little more than expected. away from that the march trade deficit of $43.7bn was marginally lower than what it was in february. factory orders rose +0.2% mom in march (vs. +0.4% expected) while february orders were also revised up. finally initial jobless claims were reported as declining 19k to 238k last week. meanwhile the only other data in europe aside from those  mis came from the uk. mortgage approvals in march fell to 66.8k (-1.1k decline) and a little bit more than expected while the m4 money supply rose +0.3% mom and +6.6% yoy (from +5.9%). looking at the day ahead, there’s nothing to report of in europe this morning. instead all eyes will be on the aforementioned us april employment report this afternoon. also due out this evening is the march consumer credit reading for the us. away from the data both the eu’s juncker and tusk are scheduled to speak today while over at the fed it is a packed day for fedspeak with fischer (4.30pm bst), williams (5.45pm bst) and yellen (6.30pm bst) all speaking at separate events while rosengren, evans and bullard are scheduled to take part in a panel debate on monetary policy at 6.30pm bst. on the earnings front it’s a quiet end to the week with berkshire hathaway the most notable release. before we sign off, it goes without saying that the big event this weekend is the french election on sunday. in terms of timing polls are due to close at 8pm bst in most of france and 9pm bst in the big cities. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at

2456,"April Payrolls Preview: ""It Better Be Good""",2017-05-05 09:04:00+00:00,"after the abysmal march labor report, all we - and the fed - can say is that april better be good, or else yellen's claim of ""transitory weakness"" will simply be the latest nail in the coffin of fed credibility. here is the consensus for the key numbers the bls will report at 8:30am et on friday morning. payrolls expectation by bank: big picture: friday’s non-farm payrolls release follows wednesday’s fomc meeting where the fed, as expected, kept rates on hold with all eyes now on june’s decision. one key takeaway from this week’s decision was the fed noting the labour market conditions continuing to strengthen as growth slowed, as it deemed that job gains had been solid despite march’s softer than expected labor market report and quasi-recessionary q1 gdp. the fed’s statement was devoid of any real negatives and has led to fed fund futures pricing in a near 80% chance of a 25bps hike at its june meeting. as ransquawk notes, the expectation for a headline print of 185k points to a solid bounce-back from last month’s 98k, with the possibility of an upward revision to last month’s release as many analysts have attributed the weakness to negative payback following a late easter holiday and an unusually warm winter in the us. however, the unemployment rate is expected to tick up to 4.6% from 4.5%, with many suggesting that last month’s fall was a result of sampling noise. goldman is even more optimistic than the consensus, and estimates payrolls increased by 200k in april, a sharp acceleration from march’s +98k pace and above the three-month moving average of +178k. it sees labor market fundamentals remaining encouraging on the whole, as april exhibited a further decline in initial jobless claims, improvement in regional service sector employment surveys, and an elevated labor market differential reported by the conference board. continuing claims also fell sharply from survey week to survey week, dropping at their fastest pace in two years (-64k). additionally, goldman believes a favorable swing in the weather –reflecting mainly the timing of winter storm stella during the march survey week – is likely to boost april job growth by roughly 25-40k relative to trend. on the negative side, the bank believes the trend in retail employment growth is now slowing, reflecting the weaker brick-and-mortar sales trends and a continued shift towards less labor-intensive e-commerce firms. we also expect minor drags on job growth from the tail end of the federal hiring freeze and from a telecom strike that continued into the survey week (a -2k impact). goldman's summary: we estimate the unemployment rate remained stable at 4.5% in april following the one tenth drop in march (to 4.496% unrounded). the pace of employment growth picked up sharply in the household survey to start the year, with 1.4 million cumulative jobs added over the past three months (adjusted for the impact of the january population controls). offsetting this improvement, the participation rate also moved higher, rising three tenths over the same period to 63.0%. while the risks to our unemployment rate forecast are likely skewed to the upside (given the possibility of mean-reversion), our base case expectation is that the rate continues to round to 4.5%. finally, we expect average hourly earnings to increase 0.3% month over month and 2.7% year over year, reflecting the interaction of firming wage growth with positive calendar effects. the april payroll period ended on the 15th, which in our model, is associated with above-average wage growth. additionally, we believe the acceleration in the employment cost index to a cycle-high pace in q1 provides additional evidence of firming underlying wage growth. recent data: wednesday’s adp employment report showed another sign of steady growth, coming in at 177k vs. the expected 175k. despite last month’s lack of correlation, the private employment figures tend to give an indication of the headline figure when viewed over a longer horizon. april’s soft data (the markit and ism pmis) point to a slowing in hiring, although all the surveys’ employment sub-indices remained in expansionary territory, with all the headline releases strong. factors arguing for a stronger report (per goldman): weather rebound. we believe the winter storms in early march likely exerted a meaningful drag on payroll growth in the last report, as winter storm stella hit the midwest and east coast at the beginning of the march survey week. the level of population-weighted snowfall during a march survey week was at its highest since at least 2005, and similarly, the month-to-month drop in april survey week snowfall is also the largest over that period. accordingly, we expect april payrolls growth to benefit, as swings of this magnitude have historically been associated with meaningful acceleration in weather-sensitive payroll categories, such as construction, retail, and leisure and hospitality (exhibit 1). exhibit 1: weather likely shifting from a drag on march payroll growth to a boost in april source: national centers for environmental information, national oceanic and atmospheric administration, bureau of labor statistics, goldman sachs global investment research regional granularity also suggests a meaningful drag from weather in the march employment report . overall payroll growth in new england, mid-atlantic, and east north central regions swung from +102k in february to -52k in march (compared to a 2016 average pace of +47k), likely reflecting unusually snowy march weather and some payback from the relatively warm february. weather-sensitive industries in the regions contributed the majority of the march deceleration. one additional consideration is that the effects of winter storm stella appear to have lingered throughout the march survey week in many populated areas. as a point of comparison, the snow produced by the january storms in the south – which did not appear to materially affect payrolls – had largely melted away by the tuesday of that survey week. this suggests scope for the april employment report to benefit from workers in the establishment survey returning to their jobs. taken together, our base case expectations assume that weather will boost april payrolls growth relative to the underlying trend by between 25k and 40k. jobless claims . initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits declined, averaging 243k during the four weeks between the march and april payroll survey periods, a new cycle low. additionally, continuing claims dropped by 65k from survey week to survey week, their largest decline over such a period since april 2015. service sector surveys . despite declines in some of the service-sector employment surveys, our overall non-manufacturing employment tracker improved in april (to 54.5 from 53.7), and all of its components remained in expansionary territory. the ism non-manufacturing (-0.2pt to 51.4), new york fed (-5.2pt to +8.5, sa by gs), dallas fed (-3.6pt to +4.5), and markit pmi services employment components softened. however, this was more than offset by a sharp rise in the philly fed subindex (+9.2pt to +26.4) and further improvement in the richmond fed employment component (+4pt to +21). the key labor market subcomponent of the consumer confidence report also remained strong, edging down by 1.1 from the cycle-high reading in march to 11.7. service sector payroll employment grew 61k in march and has increased 121k on average over the last six months. job cuts. announced layoffs reported by challenger, gray & christmas after our seasonal adjustment fell by 15k to 31k in april, a six-month low. arguing for a weaker report: continued retail weakness. retail employment growth has fallen from its historical trend of 15-20k per month to -5k on average over the past six months. while some of the march weakness was likely weather-related, we expect the structural shift of retail sales from brick and mortar stores toward less labor-intensive e-commerce firms will continue to weigh on payroll growth in that industry, with the impact on the order of 10k per month relative to its previous trend. this drag on retail employment has appeared particularly pronounced recently – with a 61k cumulative drop in retail payrolls over the last two months – and we note the possibility that weak brick and mortar sales trends in q1 may be accelerating the pace of this structural shift. exhibit 2: shift towards online retail could reduce overall job growth by roughly 10k per month source: bureau of labor statistics, goldman sachs global investment research federal hiring freeze. the administration’s hiring freeze for federal workers (excluding defense and public safety) went into effect on january 23 and concluded on april 11 – the tuesday of the april survey week. so far, its impact appears quite limited, with federal payrolls down negligibly in february and march (mom sa). as shown in exhibit 3, the impact also seems minor in the context of federal job growth during the 1981 federal hiring freeze at the start of the reagan administration (exhibit 3). thus far, government departments may have been able to offset the hiring freeze through reduced attrition or increased contracted hiring. accordingly, we expect a minimal drag from the final month of the freeze and are assuming a flat reading for total government payrolls in tomorrow’s report. exhibit 3: federal hiring freeze exerting minimal impact on payrolls so far source: bureau of labor statistics, goldman sachs global investment research telecom strike. the april employment report coincided with a strike of 2k workers in the wired telecom subindustry, which is set to reduce payroll growth in the information sector by 2k this month. n eutral factors: manufacturing sector surveys. employment components of manufacturing sector surveys were mixed in april but all remained in expansion territory. the ism manufacturing employment component fell 6.9 points to 52.0 after reaching its highest level since mid-2011 in the march report. the richmond fed (-15pt to +5) and kansas city fed (-4pt to +9) employment subindices also declined. in contrast, the empire state (+5.1 to +13.9), philly fed (+2.4pt to +19.9), dallas fed (+0.1pt to +8.5) and chicago pmi employment components all improved. manufacturing payroll employment rose 11k in april, its fourth consecutive increase, and has increased 10k on average over the last six months. adp. the payroll processing firm adp reported a 177k increase in private payroll employment in april – about as expected – suggesting a stable underlying pace of job growth. the adp measure overshot considerably to the upside relative to bls private payroll growth in march (+255k vs. +89k), making the task of teasing out the underlying signal from the report more difficult. we believe the 177k pace of private job gains was encouraging on the whole, and we also expect the rebound from winter storm stella to show up more visibly in friday’s employment report. job availability. the conference board’s help wanted online (hwol) report showed a modest decrease in april online job postings (-1%) following february’s uptick (+2%). however, we continue to place limited weight on this indicator at the moment, in light of research by fed economists that suggests the hwol ad count has been depressed by higher prices for online job ads. some other observations: fed impact : the impact on the fed’s thinking could be slightly more in focus following last month’s headline 98k. despite the employment growth average still sitting well above the fed’s threshold for moving towards full employment, another big miss could begin to throw up some questions for the central bank. at present the rate path and the fed’s message remain clear, and as a result it would seemingly take a string of poor labour market reports to derail the fed’s plans to deliver two more 25bps hikes this year. there are also wider factors in play within the fed’s thought process, such as an inflated stock market, its large balance sheet and the trump administration’s proposed fiscal stimulus. market reaction: a s ever, fast money moves will surround the initial headline. a stronger than expected number historically sends the usd higher and treasuries lower with the opposite tending to be the case for a weaker number, before markets digest some of the other details of the report. h/t: @ransquawk tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ]

2460,"""Someone Is Blowing Up"": RBC Warns China-Induced Unwinds Are Escalating",2017-05-05 04:38:00+00:00,"""something is off,"" warns rbc's head of cross-asset strategy charlie mcelligott in the introduction to his latest market noting that the swing in us fiscal policy optimism is coming at a critical time as the china's liquidity tightening is spooking the reflation story . movement on us fiscal policy is currently driving us rates and equities higher, counteracting the tremendous negative implications of this ‘chinese tightening / deleveraging’ story and the impact this is having upon commodities (industrial metals & crude) and thus, ‘inflation expectations.’ ‘connecting the dots’ between the crude oil / commodities selloff and a strong (negative) reversal in ‘mean reversion strategies’ both cross- and inter- sector (energy) within equities, as well as notable drawdowns in ‘momentum’ market-neutral strategies over the past few weeks. *  *  * the big +++ story overnight: republicans are planning a ‘make or break’ vote on the aca repeal today, as the gop feels they now have the votes to pass the trump campaign healthcare promise. this sudden swing to ‘movement’ / optimism speaks to the ‘pessimistic overshoot’ seen across the street with regards to the consensually negative view on ‘fiscal policy’ implementation, following the administration’s / republicans’ self-inflicted wounds of the past few months. now, this opens the door again to not just tax reform (as it creates a much more benign revenue ‘starting point’ for tax-cut offsets), but potentially infrastructure as well, which might too be bundled into the tax plan.  yes, none of this is ‘imminent’ per se, but the sentiment-inflection here is swift and of extreme importance to the ‘reflation’ trade. as such, equity futures and us nominal rates are currently holding higher, despite what looks to be a total breakdown in crude oil and commodities turning outright ugly now. and today is seeing the move accelerate... with the biggest single day drop since nov 2016... this newly-found ‘us fiscal policy optimism’ could not have come at a better time for the ‘reflation’ camp, who have been sweating bullets in recent days because our much-discussed ‘chinese tightening / deleveraging’ theme is playing-out real-time and wreaking havoc on global commodities--particularly with industrial metals (dalian iron ore limit-down overnight -8.0% and reopening down another -5% today). look at the carnage on the shanghai futures exchange, particularly in the mtd / qtd columns: this comes following the total meltdown in copper (-4.0%, and another -1.7% move this a.m.) during yesterday’s us session, while too we see the breakdown in the crude oil complex accelerating with wti making ytd lows this morning while falling through its trend-support line dating back to last august. bhp and rio are the proxy for the breakdown in the equities-complex (while a popular us equities ‘inflation’ basket is crushed a massive -4.3% over the past five days), while too we see china- / resources- levered aud come unglued in the fx space, now -2.3% month-to-date despite a very ‘meh’ usd.  at the same time, we’ve now seen weaker chinese manu pmis and caixin composite pmis over the past week, in conjunction with an ism manufacturing misses in us. all of this is tied-into the enhanced chinese efforts to deleverage the economy via ‘measured tightening’ (higher money markets rates—see o/n shibor again making new 2 year highs last evening) and reduced liquidity (net removals as mlf loans roll-off versus now-smaller / not offsetting rr cash injections and omo’s). in conjunction with these quantitative efforts, the chinese are also ‘cracking down’ on shadow financing and wealth management products, both of which participate in the liquidity / commodity-price feedback daisy-chain (to my point yesterday and in the past on higher short-term rates acting as ‘margin calls’ on ‘commodities as collateral’ financing trades). mark orsley and i have been working on a “chinese liquidity monitor” which tracks the pboc’s various measures (repos, reverse repos, omos, slfs, mlfs, pledged supplementary programs)—see below. the key point here: it’s not just the sharp decline in the ‘rate of change’ of pboc ‘lending’ / ‘financing’ / ‘credit creation’….it’s that liquidity is being outright removed. it makes total sense too— the chinese have recently used the ‘air-cover’ of the fed’s own tightening to conduct their own --so the current timing is perfect, as a june fomc hike became that much more of a ‘lock’ after yesterday’s hawkish message was successfully delivered (looking through the q1 data softness as “transitory”). the simple fact is that global liquidity--and thus, financial conditions as well--are tightening. us real rates are gapping-tighter, as 5y tips yields have swung from -24bps on april 12th to this morning’s +13bps.  3m libor has more than doubled since june and currently sits at highs since march 2009.  as mentioned earlier, overnight shibor printed another new 2 year high, same for chinese 10y government bond yields. us nominals are back approaching the upper end of their recent range as well.  yes, if this was a pure reflection of growth, it would be an outright ‘risk-asset positive.’  but it’s much more nuanced than that, especially from the chinese ‘demand driver’ impact on the global economy.  tighter financial conditions à slower growth à lower inflation. from a risk-perspective though, this is then counter-balanced via by-and-large ‘still expansionary’ global pmis, big corporate earnings growth and now, into the aforementioned (and sudden) positive uptick in sentiment around us fiscal policy movement. if fiscal can re-jigger ‘animal spirits’ (especially on the ‘optimism’- / confidence- side), then it becomes much more attractive to put those ‘reflation trades’ back on (rates shorts, long cyclicals / banks / value factor, potential to re-load usd length as well).  to this point, i will continue watching that 2.40 / .45 level (smack-dab btwn 50- and 100-dma’s in ust 10y yields and the overhead resistance level since late-march—h/t mark orsley)… while still feeling confidence that this ‘chinese tightening’ story (and the impact it is have on commodities and thus, global inflation expectations) will keep us rates ‘anchored’ despite the fed’s hiking intentions. in yesterday’s note, i pointed-out particularly acute ‘unwind’ price-action in us equity 1m ‘momentum’ factor market neutral strategies seen on tuesday—as ‘momo leaders’ were splattered, while ‘momo losers’ squeezed sharply-higher. we have now seen a ‘clustering’ of 1.5- to 2.0- standard-deviation drawdowns in the strategy over the past few weeks (almost dating-back to the start of the quarter frankly), which is anecdotally quite atypical in a ‘flat to up’ intraday tape. it would be safe to surmise that there is either signaling a rotation that is playing-out in the market, or conversely, an unwind of some sort. looking back to the start of the quarter though, we haven’t really seen that sector- or factor-level rotation generally-speaking, as thematically, ‘growth’ factors / sectors continue to lead, while at the bottom, we see cyclicals / value / anti-beta still lagging, as they have all year.   but if looking at a strategy such as ‘prior quarter mean reversion’ you begin to see something interesting. this is crude, but using a simple ‘q1 mean reversion’ proxy (deployed in q2), where i go long energy (worst perf s&p sector q1) vs short tech (best perf s&p sector q1), i see significant signs of ‘stress’ or outright unwind in recent weeks. the above portfolio run $-neutral has experienced a near 5% swing over the past 3 weeks, with the loss doubling over the past week alone--it’s likely this ‘rate of change’ that is the problem from the risk management perspective. this of course correlates with the breakdown occurring in crude oil, as wti is now -11.8% over the past three weeks. sector-specific within energy, you see signs as well. energy equities trader ryan businski noted the following ‘unwind’ behavior across texas shale plays: “seeing long sales across the niobrara names today forcing unwinds/covering in bakken names. wll, oas, clr rallying with no news bakken related.” with the sector now -10.4% ytd within the s&p / -20.3% within the russell, alongside a lot of talk in recent-weeks of a number of multi-manager shops shuttering energy books, i feel comfortable in stating that somebody’s ‘mean-reversion’ strategy (likely a stat arb / quant fund) has triggered ‘stop outs’ as the underlying commodities space now ‘catches down’ to the behavior already exhibited across the energy equities space throughout the course of 2017. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com

2486,"Fasanara Capital Explains How The ""Fake Market"" Works In One Chart",2017-05-04 20:06:00+00:00,"via francesco filia of fasanara capital “learn how to see. realize that everything connects to everything else.” – leonardo da vinci hard data ceased to be a driver for markets, valuation metrics for bonds and equities which held valid for over a century are now deemed secondary. narratives and money flows trump hard data, overwhelmingly. ‘fake markets’ are defined as markets where the magnitude and duration of artificial flows from global central banks or passive investment vehicles have managed to overwhelm and narcotize data-dependency and macro factors . a stuporous state of durable, un-volatile over-valuation , arrested activity, unconsciousness produced by the influence of artificial money flows. markets driven by central banks, passive investment vehicles and retail investors are unfit to price any premium for any risk. if we are right and this is indeed a bubble (both in equity and in bonds), it will eventually bust ; it is only a matter of time. the higher it goes, the higher it can go, as more swathes of private investors are pulled in. the more violently it can subsequently bust. the risk of a combined bust of equity and bonds is a plausible one . it matters all the more as 90%+ of investors still work under the basic framework of a balanced portfolio , exposed in different proportions to equity and bonds, both long. that includes risk parity funds , a leveraged version of balanced portfolio. that includes alternative risk premia funds , a nice commercial disguise for a mostly long-only beta risk, where premia is extracted from record rich markets that made those premia tautologically minuscule. *  *  * these days, it seems acknowledged by most that we live in the age of ‘post-truth’, ‘false equivalency’, ‘alternative facts’ and ‘fake news’. all concepts that revolve around the irrelevance of hard facts, truth, objectivity or accuracy: as frustrating as it is, this refers to the proven and full ability to cherry pick across data – or worse, fabricate them – so to support whatever argument one has, while advancing whatever agenda behind it. hard facts are a thing of the past, what matters now is what works, what is instrumental to achieve a goal. david hume’s ‘matter of facts’ are repealed and replaced by opportunism, sophism, or machiavellianism. in financial markets, we may be observing a similar phenomenon. hard data have ceased to be a driver for markets, valuation metrics for bonds and equities which held valid for over a century are now deemed secondary . narratives and money flows trump hard data, overwhelmingly. consider this: us gdp for the first quarter came out at less than a fourth of what was expected only in february, yet equity markets found reasons not to bat an eyelash, and be higher now than they were back then. us equities are valued at cyclically-adjusted multiples only seen in the two of the most glamorous bubbles featured in history books (1929 and 2000), against levels of potential gdp way lower than back then, yet volatility is at all-time lows: vix dipped below 10 – to follow realized volatility at 7 – something rarely seen before, except perhaps in days when markets are shut down.. indeed, amazingly, us equity volatility was lower than long treasuries volatility, over the last 4 years. ‘fake markets’ are defined as markets where the magnitude and duration of artificial flows from global central banks or passive investment vehicles have managed to overwhelm and narcotize data-dependency and macro factors . a stuporous state of durable, un-volatile over-valuation, arrested activity, unconsciousness produced by the influence of artificial money flows. let’s give a cursory look at the monumental numbers involved for artificial flows. since the beginning of the year, baml estimates that central banks – ecb, fed, boj, boe, snb – have bought financial assets for a staggering $ 1 trillion . despite entering the tapering phase, this was the largest cb buying in 10 years , at $ 3.6 trn annualized . a ‘ liquidity supernova’ that trumps all other flows. to baml, understandably, this was ”the best possible explanation for why global stocks and bonds annualize double-digit gains despite le pen, trump, china, macro.” this alone could be the only flow that matters. but there is more, in fact. passive money flows have relentlessly grown over recent years, months and weeks, to represent the next biggest buyer: a juggernaut of $ 8 trillions global firepower, long-only, mostly fully invested, often accounting for 90%+ of equity daily flows in the us . this number is arrived at by summing three categories of passive-type investor vehicles: (i) etfs/etps and index funds, (ii) risk parity and volatility-driven funds, (iii) trend-chasing algos. from our november 2016 outlook (please get in touch for a copy), we briefly described the unfolding of a dangerous market structure : “one could be excused for thinking that, given the long list of looming risks in the current market environment, for one to be long-only, and fully-invested, one has to be a machine. and the average investor these days is exactly that: a machine. these days, more so than ever before in financial history, market flows are dominated by passive index funds or etfs/etps (at $4trn after leverage, according to morningstar, strategic insight), risk-parity funds or volatility-driven strategies ($3.75trn after leverage, according to rbc), trend-following algos/cta ($0.5trn). altogether, after leverage, they represent close to $8 trillions of assets in firepower, across asset classes. the issue is the most dramatic in equities, where close to 90% of flows can be attributed to passive strategies, from 7% 15 years ago , according to vanguard/cfa institute data. such predominance derives from the fact that average turnover on etfs is over 10 times bigger than the turnover of the underlying stock positions . by analyzing the 100 largest etfs, valued at $1.5trn, cfa institute found out that they turned over an annualized volume of 14trn, while the 100 largest stocks, valued $12trn, turned over 15trn over the same period. according to horizon kinetics, turnover rates for two of the most popular etfs is higher at 3,500% . in 2015 there were 1,594 etfs, from just 204 in 2005, all the while as the number of listed stocks declined. the rate of growth here is even more staggering than the absolute amounts, and should command attention (so much as the recent explosion in growth in corporate china debt does). only few years back, such elephant in the room was just a disney’s dumbo: it grew exponentially into a mammoth in the very recent past. and one will be excused for reminding that the day volatility rises markedly or the market trend is compromised – beyond a certain tipping point – they will simultaneously, mechanically and un-emotionally elect to lighten up: a sell avalanche waiting to unload. that herding behavioral pattern alone will determine the difference between a mild correction offering the opportunity to buy-the-dip and a deep damaging correction, between a january 2016-type snorkeling and a lehman-type deep dive , between a gradual decline and a flash crash .” specifically on etfs, the tsunami is overwhelming. as of end january, etfs and passive funds represented almost 30% of aum in the us . pwc expects global aum on just etfs to grow to $7trn by 2021 . morgan stanley estimated that $87bn were poured into us listed etfs through the first two months of the year alone, which was impressive given that the average over the past 7 years has been $ 17bn. the product is so hot that vanguard, to compete, felt compelled to cut fees 3 time s from late january to mid-february, in a race-to-zero against rivals. etfs are taking over markets. in doing so, they are getting meta , as an etf on etfs was launched last month: tetf will be composed of stocks of companies driving the growth of the etf industry. sometimes, etfs are so big in respect of their underlying reference market that are forced to buy other etfs . a sought-after junior miner gold etf got larger than its index recently. so much so that it was forced to buy other etfs. incredibly, there are 10 canadian companies that this etf owns where its ownership percentage is more than 18%. for six of those companies, the percentage would be even greater, but presumably, the fund does not want to exceed the 20% level, which, under canadian rules, would force the etf “to automatically extend a takeover offer to all remaining shareholders at the same terms,” according to a report by scotiabank. oftentimes, etfs state a level of liquidity difficult to find in their reference market . the etf euro corporate bond investment grade trades with approx. 20 cents bid/offer, while very few of its underlying bonds can enjoy that, and most have 3x that. interestingly, the etf select dividend lost 35% during august 2015 at a time when its constituencies lost just 2.5%, showing that disconnections work both ways when the time comes. etfs are naturally perceived to offer too high a level of diversification. this is not always true. take, for instance, the case of one of the largest us energy etf, where 50% of the fund is held in just four stocks. the impact of etfs on markets has just started to be analyzed in details. jpm here explains what causes the 3.30pm market’s ramp up on us markets : ‘this is because these passive funds have to rebalance by the end of the day, different to active funds that have the discretion to wait before they deploy their cash balances’. it results in 37% of the nyse trading volumes ytd taking place during the last 30 mins of trading . a growing body of research blames etfs for reducing markets efficiency, creating stock markets that are both ‘mindless’ and ‘too expensive’: researchers d. israeli, c. lee and s. sridharan wrote in a paper last month: “our evidence suggests the growth of etf may have (unintended) long-run consequences for the pricing efficiency of the underlying securities. a single percentage point increase in etf ownership has demonstrable effects on an individual stock. over the ensuing year, correlation to the share’s industry group and the broader market ticks up 9%, while the relationship between its price and future earnings falls 14%. meanwhile, bid-ask spreads rise 1.6% and absolute returns grow 2%“. the move into etfs is clearly emphasizing the role of private investors in driving markets . it should also be noted that, incidentally, private client have historically correlated well with market peaks . to be sure, etfs themselves are great financial innovation . what one must consider though, is its implications for price discovery (do they make bubble/bust cycles more extreme?), liquidity (is liquidity overstated?), market responsiveness (is volatility depressed but tail risks bigger?). specifically to this market cycle, it is worth asking also what happens when the liquidity tide turns on qe ending, or when markets dive . most obviously, there can be no certainty that central banks, etfs, passive strategies, retail are necessarily the dominant factor out there driving price discovery in today’s markets. however, those thinking they are not must have a strong argument as to why, big as they are, they do not matter. and if they do matter, how much of them is factored into current prices. and also, again, what happens when central banks run out of road (as is happening) and markets move in reverse for any or no reason/catalyst. it is not those flows alone, but their impact on the investment mentality of what is left of active investors. from the lens of behavioral finance , here is what active investors are likely to deduct from recent market events: so, this is to say that not only passive investors’ success brings in more passive investors and gradually changes the structure of the markets, but it affects the behavior of leftover active investors too, through ‘recency bias’. it induces herd behaviors, crowd positioning and concentration of risk – which then becomes systemic. in contrast, we believe that much of the typical market response was indeed influenced by the artificial flows of central banks enforcing their put, and long-only passive investors programmed to buy-the-dip. also, it can be said that association was not causality. a risk badly priced before a market-positive event (macron winning) remains a risk that was badly priced. a risk badly priced after a market-negative event (brexit, trump, italian referendum, etc) remains a risk, waiting to strike. the illusion of knowledge is one we must find the energy to resist to. from our previous outlook : “when we put our human minds to analyze the strong rebounds following sell-offs in oct2014, august 2015, january-february 2016, june 2016, november 2016 and we attribute it to the narratives shifting rapidly and the market re-assessing the likely consequences of certain catalyst events (like trump, brexit, deflation etc.), we may all actually be fooling ourselves a little, thinking so many thinkers are out there are thinking . within the last very few years, ruled-based passive-aggressive investment vehicles of all sorts joined the investment communities and exploded enormously into the multi-trillions, and are affecting the output we look at and try to use logical deduction upon.” this induction trap may also help explain why not only markets are as high as they are, in definitive bubble territory when measured against fundamentals on most metrics ever utilized in modern financial history, but also why so few commentators and analysts are compelled to call it as it is: a bubble. the market is at bubble levels based on, among others, the buffet indicator (market cap to gdp , “the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment”) and the shiller indicator (cape earnings multiple). professor shiller even won a nobel prize for his studies on market inefficiency (as he discovered that stock prices can be predicted over a longer period). yet, curiously, neither buffet nor shiller do call it a bubble. far from it. surely, it is never really popular to call a bubble: it always takes time for it to blow up and, meanwhile, there is too much vested interest and people benefiting from it. also, you run the risk of being singled out for being non-constructive or for ‘fake news’. or, perhaps, they truly think this time is different. investors looking for ex-post rationalizations can hang on to economic narratives . for any market response, there is a narrative that makes it taste and feel like it was bound to happen all along. narratives evolve and accompany market evolutions, instead of recognizing artificial markets for what they are. there is a form of spiritual faith within today’s markets that reminds of philosopher daniel dennet’s skyhooks . in promoting modern science over religion, dennet differentiates between ‘cranes’ and ‘skyhooks’. cranes are explanations that use scientific materialism, while skyhooks resort to miracles or non-material causes to explain things. cranes would be here a metaphor for historically-tested valuation metrics and fundamentals, while skyhooks are elusive, over-fitting, ever-evolving narratives . there was a narrative for tech stocks in 2000 – they would change the paradigm – and one for real estate prices in 2007 – they never went down on a nationwide basis. in both cases large gap downside risks were ignored, in a form of blind faith in market’s efficiency. our take. don’t pretend this is normal. admit this is no proper market functioning but you follow flows until it lasts. when it stops, you expect market risks to be mutualized, again, as back then. as always, narratives are ex-post easy explanations for what happened, obvious only in retrospect. to us, the structure of the market and central banking create a tide of liquidity that overwhelms all headwinds, for now . however, over a longer horizon, it historically paid to 1) stick to fundamentals and 2) price risk appropriately. number crunching leads to the conclusion that prices are very high at the same time as systemic risks are very high. after the longest-lasting streak of us job recovery in recorded history, we are at end-cycle, at best. central banking is gradually exiting the stage, after bringing long rates to historical lows. rising rates meet leverage ratios that are now way larger than before. the structure of the market is flaky and dangerous, populated by passive vehicles and retail. this cannot be the ideal setting for buying more bonds and equities, or staying fully invested . step back: a bit of number crunching to remind ourselves of the extreme valuations of risky assets these days . the bubble in bonds is widely accepted as inevitable, given that major central banks are hovering up most net issuance every month. the bubble in equity is not consensus . most consider current valuations as justified by either forward earnings or goldilocks scenarios, strength in soft data or recovery gaining momentum. in our opinion, equity markets are in bubble territory, and have been there for some time now , following years of monumental monetary printing by global central banks. the ensuing collapsing yields pushed investors into riskier asset classes, such as equity. since march 2009, equities returned almost 20% annualised in the us (+250% in absolute value), and almost 12% annualised in europe (+140% in absolute value). most gains occurred as way of multiple expansions, while real profits growth was the slowest in 30 years . the equity bubble is most visible in the us, where most valuation metrics are out of whack: to be sure, there is one metric out there that may be argued to be less definitive: the comparison between dividend yields and bond yields. equity premia are decent when measured against minuscule bond yields. yet, if one concurs bonds are in a bubble (with yields at close to 5,000 years lows), then comparison to a bubble does not make you any less of a bubble yourself . p/es are admittedly inflated by the energy sector , where averages are extreme so to incorporate markets’ rosy expectations of a strong rebound in sector earnings to come. we disagree to that too, as we expect oil to revisit lows in the not so distant future. we expand on it later in this note. the market tends to forget how much of current valuations is due to quantitative easing and financial repression policymaking , at a time in which qe is running out of road , most central banks openly evaluate exit strategies, as they are confronted with rising levels of cost-push inflation and lower systemic risks of global deflation (partly due to de-globalisation trends and protectionism). yields started rising, like the seconds in a clock that resumed ticking, running towards wake-up call time . since july last year, indeed, well before trump won the us elections, rates had started detaching themselves from generational lows. they will likely represent a most important headwind for equity valuations going forward. in superfluous further evidence of monetary addiction , gmo estimates fomc days account for 25% of the total real returns in us equities we have witnessed since 1984: if not for returns on fomc meeting days, current valuations would be much lower. despite being in over-valuation territory, signs of complacency abound. for starters, the vix index trades at just above 10 (it dipped to 9-handle this week) , while realized volatility is even lower than that. end april was its fourth only monthly close below 11 in recorded history, after jan 1994, jan 2007, nov 2006. moreover, short interest on s&p, judging from its biggest etf, is the lowest it has been in 10 years , in a clear sign of capitulation for bearish players. there cannot be much less doubt in the mind of investors. no vertigo at all-time highs. only faithful swinging from one skyhook to the next. surprisingly to some, european equities are not much cheaper either. on a forward earnings multiple basis they are only two/three points cheaper than us stocks, for a 20% p/e discount, much in line with historical averages . over several decades, european equities have typically traded at a discount to us equities. this is normally explained as due to less economic activism / animal spirit, less efficient crisis policymaking, more bureaucracy and regulations in welfare societies, more dependency on energy and mining, em and the international cycle. hardly an unwarranted discount. andrew lapthorne at société générale analyses it in further details, (i) across absolute value p/es, (ii) median valuation metrics so to neutralize most composition arguments (us overwhelmed by tech, eu dominated by financials), (iii) and trend-based earnings denominators (cape p/e, trend eps). he reaches the following conclusion: ”the question comes down to not one of valuation but of profitability. the profitability gap between the us and the eu is largely a function of weakness in financials and a greater use of leverage by us non-financial corporates.” james mackintosh at the wsj interestingly points out that “european cheapness is concentrated in banks, which still scare many, and oil stocks, which only look cheaper because of the collapse in us shale profits.” it follows that european equities are not much cheaper than us stocks and no more so than historical averages. then again, if us stocks are in a bubble, european stocks show a small (and historically fairly-sized) discount to a bubble . let alone the political instability in europe, which is on the rise, moving from one narrowly avoided conflagration (french elections) to the next (italian elections, after a recently failed italian referendum). we will touch upon eu politics in the next section. in our bearish assessment of where we stand, as we consider systemic risks both large and widely ignored, we could well be proven wrong by the course of events from here. few obvious scenarios proving us wrong are as follows: as always, we will only know with time. we do not believe such scenarios to be likely. yet, they could definitively materialize. they are plausible. we think, though, that the blue-sky scenario is consensus . how else could you explain p/e shiller at 30 and vix at 10, effortlessly? talks of the ‘most hated bull market ever’ have always left us baffled. hated by who, by how many? as visible in where? is this because p/e are not at 50 and vix at 5? the one point we would like to make, then, is that a price for risk is nowhere in the picture here . as big a risk as it is, risk will be zero only upon completion of a successful course of events. we will only know with time. if risk is factored in, however mild a version, a bullish stance at current levels is unwarranted . if risk does not materialize into a catalyst event, it does not follow that risk never existed in the first place. to be bullish at current levels is to be pure gamblers, a case of greed trumping groundedness. *  *  * markets driven by central banks, passive investment vehicles and retail investors are unfit to price any premium for any risk. if we are right and this is indeed a bubble (both in equity and bonds), it will eventually bust; it is only a matter of time . the higher it goes, the higher it can go, as more swathes of private investors are pulled in. the more violently it can subsequently bust. it remains to be seen if it is more of a 2008-type environment, the moment before a steep correction; or rather a 1999-type moment, whereby a melt-up preceded a sudden sell-off. the final outcome remains the same, as quitting years of qe and stimuli will be rough. for the fund, the takeaway of all the above is to be able to risk manage positions efficiently so to buy time for the views to materialise: be short, be ready, be patient . we do concur with most analysts (and central bankers) that inflation resurfaced , and therefore yields bottomed in july last year. that is the problem. that will matter, at some point down this road. the risk of a combined bust of both the equity and the bond bubble is a plausible one . it matters all the more as 90%+ of investors still work under the basic framework of a balanced portfolio , exposed in different proportions to equities and bonds, both long. that includes risk parity funds , a leveraged version of balanced portfolio. that includes alternative risk premia funds , a nice commercial disguise for a mostly long-only beta risk, where premia is extracted from record rich markets that made those premia tautologically minuscule. it follows that, unusually, balanced funds and their derivatives/surrogates will be the least safe, should this unraveling scenario materialize . which is to say that such scenario affects no single niche of the industry – like subprime mortgages in 2007, or tech in 2000, or russia in 1998, or like today’s us student loans, auto loans, china’s shadow banking, property bubbles in china or canada, etc – but rather it affects head-on 90% of the investing community, on their bread and butter established best practice. under this theory, we should not worry of any one pocket of trouble to metastasize throughout to create systemic risk, but rather about the system itself, badly positioned for a synchronized deflating of bubbles in equity and bonds . if we move alongside trend-line, the day will come for a true stress-test to occur, the first one in 40 years. yields never consistently rose, while spiking, before. equities never consistently fell simultaneously to that, in decades. it may never happen but it is a plausible scenario, and to some (us) it is right alongside trend-line from here. the trend-line is drawn on such data points as (i) qe reaching capacity and then qe exit, (ii) yields detaching from zero after a 40 years rally, (iii) equities at stratospheric valuations, (iv) cost-push inflation resurfacing, (v) demographics, (vi) disruption from 4 th industrial revolution and crumbling labor participation rates. this scenario is all the more interesting because it is totally priced out. nowhere to be seen in pricing, allowing for asymmetric profiles. we positively look at such downside gap risk as the great unchecked opportunity of today’s markets , asymmetrically profiled against little marginal upside from current levels, at a time when very few investors are left standing in the bearish camp. it should also be noted that, during prolonged periods of bull markets, the financial industry at large has little incentive to wake up, as in the process big fees are earned . short-term, it does not pay to be unpopular, independent thinkers. still, if it is the right thing to do, it must be done. quoting buffett where buffett would surely disagree, “markets are voting machines in the short-term but are weighting machine in the long term.” if it is indeed a bubble, assuming it is, it will eventually bust, sooner or later. longer-term, it pays to be ready. it also pays to be patient, though. it is not the environment where to bet the ranch on the unraveling of the bubble anytime soon: when it happens it will happen fast but it may take time. to be patient means to dose the amount of outright shorts, so to keep solvent for longer than the markets stay irrational. be short: being long today’s is to listen up to ulysses’ sirens, after having read homer’s odyssey. we have all the tools to define a bubble, and yet when it comes before us in plain sight all we can hear is: “a bubble can be only recognized in retrospect, when it busts”. something like saying: let me see who wins and i’ll tell you my prognostic. there is no point for number-crunching active investors to be long at these levels, neither stocks nor bonds, except for the purpose of earning management fees in the process. bull positioning is best left to etfs and robo-investors, robo-advisors: nobody will be able to blame them for not spotting this was a bubble. this is what we mean when we say: be short, be patient, be ready. it will happen. when it happens, we are there. full fasanara investor letter below: tips: tips [ at ]

2488,"What Could Lead To A ""Volatility Explosion"": JPM's Kolanovic Explains",2017-05-04 19:17:00+00:00,"less than a month after the latest forecast from jpm's marko kolanovic left something to be desired, when the famous quant said "" it is no longer prudent to buy the dip "" only for the dip to be furiously bought, whether by algos or etfs, "" gandalf "" is back with another discussion of his favorite topic, and an emphasis on a issue that is near to all traders' hearts, namely what could lead to a ""volatility explosion."" asking rhetorically "" what will happen to market volatility "", kolanovic first observes what everyone knows, namely that ""volatility is near all-time lows"" and adds that "" the main drivers of low volatility are the currently low level of correlations, supply of options through risk premia products, and impact of option (gamma) hedging that is suppressing realized volatility (see here). following the march option expiry and ahead of french elections, positioning reversed leading to a short-lived increase of volatility . this has now fizzled out in the aftermath of the 1st round of elections. selling of volatility is one of the key parts of risk premia/smart beta programs. our estimate is that ~20% of risk premia strategies are allocated to selling volatility."" he goes on to note that selling of volatility is one of the key parts of risk premia/smart beta programs. one of the main reasons for the now daily eod vix slam is that a whopping ~20% of risk premia strategies are allocated to selling volatility across asset classes (and about half of volatility selling is via equity options). why engage in such risky trading? selling of volatility is a yield-generating strategy that can be benchmarked against bond yields. hence, declining bond yields invite more option selling activity . increased supply of options also suppresses market realized volatility through hedging activity. it goes without saying, the key risk of option selling programs is market crash risk . if one believes there’s a reduced probability of a market crash, volatility selling strategies look even more attractive, the jpm quant states. the culprits encouraging such potentially destructive ""investing"" are familiar: "" global central banks have helped in both aspects by lowering yields and reducing tail risks. indirectly, central banks have managed market volatility over the past decade."" kolanovic then points out a chart that is familiar to regular zh readers: ""figure 3 shows changes in global central banks’ assets (6-month change), and volatility of global equity markets (6-month volatility of msci world). one can see that in the 2007-13 period, central bank asset  purchases closely followed market volatility (see crises in 2008-09, 2010 and 2011 )."" this is just another way of showing the famous ""volatility suppression"" regime implemented by central banks. this level of correlation to market volatility gave confidence to volatility sellers. the large qe3 program (sep 2012 – oct 2014), was enacted during a period of improved macro outlook and declining volatility. this was the first disconnect between central bank purchases and market risk . qe3 coincided with a ~43% rally in the s&p 500. due to declining volatility, the s&p 500 sharpe ratio was above 2 in 2013 and 2014 (s&p 500 increased ten times more than the ~4.3% increase in hourly wages). as the fed exited qe3, the boj and ecb stepped in aggressively in 2015 . there were concerns about china, there was brexit and the us elections, but the gap between macro risk (as measured by market volatility) and central bank purchases kept on widening. this brings us to the current wide gap – with a near-record pace of  central bank balance sheet expansion (highest since 2011) and record-low levels of market volatility. this has further emboldened volatility sellers and other strategies that increase leverage based on market volatility (e.g., volatility targeting, risk parity, etc.). which brings us to the punchline: "" at this junction, the key question is when and how will this end. will volatility just grind higher as the central banks start normalizing, or will it explode and wipe out some volatility sellers and levered strategies in the process."" the jpm strategist states that in his opinion, ""volatility will not explode on its own. for instance, ~$50bn of potential outflows due to seasonality is likely not a match to the ~10 times higher ecb and boj bond inflows. a sharp increase of volatility will require stronger catalysts or a combination of few catalysts. some thoughts on this are shared below. "" and the ""near-term catalysts"" in question: with the french election results almost certain, renewed dialogue between the us and russia on syria, and north korea tensions elevated but steady, the short-term risks we highlighted last month are fading. the focus is now back on central banks, with the probability of a june 14th hike rising after the fomc meeting yesterday (probability now at ~80%). a potential risk-off scenario could be a combination of macroeconomic data slowing, but the fed proceeding with normalization. neither a modest macro slowdown nor fed tightening is likely to tip over the market on its own. however, if it happens in the seasonally weak time period, and if it trips up some of the volatility sensitive strategies (e.g., volatility selling, volatility targeting, etc.) the increase of volatility could be more substantial. f or these reasons investors should closely monitor incoming macro data such as tomorrow’s payrolls. there is of course an alternative scenario: one where volatility crashes even more: there are also positive catalysts that could lead to the market moving higher. the us earnings season was positive, and the market currently prices in a very low probability of us tax reform. many stocks that would benefit from the pro-business policies of the current administration (such as tax beneficiary stocks, deregulation beneficiaries, etc.) gave back almost all their post-election outperformance relative to the market. us tax reform is therefore an asymmetric catalyst with risk skewed to the upside. and perhaps most notably, this time unlike before, kolanovic refuses to further stake his reptuation and make an explicit prediction either way for one simple reason: in this market, even the most sophisticated and experienced traders have no idea what will happen next. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China North Korea Volatility Equity Markets Central Banks ETC Bond Market Crash,1
2515,"S&P Futures Jump Ahead Of GOP Healthcare Vote, Ignore China Commodity Crash",2017-05-04 11:51:00+00:00,"s&p futures rose on hopes a successful republican healthcare vote on thursday will unlock the trump fiscal agenda, while european shares jumped to a 20 month high on signs macron is poised to win sunday's french election coupled with reassuring corporate results, including strong earnings from hsbc, even as chinese and australian stocks fell as commodities, and iron ore futures particularly, tumbled. oil also declined while the bloomberg dollar spot index fell 0.1% in london morning trading, after gaining 0.4% wednesday. it weakened against all but two of its group of 10 peers. as reported overnight , iron ore traded in china plunged limit down (-8%) in the afternoon session, with rubber also limit down (7% lower), and steel rebar, coke, coking coal tumbling over 6% on concerns a crackdown on wealth management products and shadow banking in general - in addition to the worst service sector pmi print in nearly a year - could result in a hard-landing for the chinese economy (something both pimco and kyle bass warned about in the past 24 hours). of note: the drop in iron ore prices was the biggest so far this year. concerns about a crackdown of credit in china also dragged 10-yr treasury futures lower, down 0.44% at the close, while the 21st century business herald reported that chinese borrowing costs in april surged with the average coupon rate up near 200bp. chinese worries however were lost on europe, if only for the time being, after europe reported a stronger than expected service pmi print , rising to 56.4 from 56.0, beating expectations of 56.2, the 46th consecutive month of expansion and the highest reading since april 2011. of note: italy posted a nearly 10 year ago on its composite pmi category. helping european risk sentiment, a poll showing macron had outperformed far-right candidate marine le pen in a televised debate sent short-term french bond yields to their lowest in five months, with encouraging euro zone data also helping the mood.  the most recent oddschecker data showed that the market now gives macron a 90% probability of victory. additionally, a flurry of stronger than expected earnings updates in europe sent the stoxx 600 up 0.4% to its highest since august 2015, gaining for the day in a row, and included a smaller-than-feared fall in bank giant hsbc's profits which sent its shares up more than 3%.  the stoxx europe 600 and ftse 100 also headed higher. oil and gas stocks were also up 1.1 percent following robust updates from both statoil and royal dutch shell, which rose 3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. a rebounding european economy and a string of upbeat earnings are prompting firms from morgan stanley to deutsche asset management to boost allocations to the region’s stocks. after trailing for most of last year, the stoxx europe 600 index has outpaced the s&p 500 index. ""there are a number of things playing out at the moment. traditionally in may there is a strong dollar effect and that is adding to the pressure on the commodity bloc,"" said unicredit's head of fx strategy vasileios gkionakis. ""in europe it is slightly different. there is what is going on with the french election and we have been seeing some strong data."" “we see more value in europe versus the u.s.,” deutsche asset’s global head of research phil poole said in an interview with bloomberg tv’s mark barton. the investment arm of deutsche bank ag increased allocation to europe in its multi-asset portfolios from the lowest on record in the past quarter, poole said. “valuations are attractive, the european economy is growing. we feel there’s too much optimism priced into the trump stimulus program.” in the us, s&p 500 futures climbed on hopes obamacare will get repealed giving a fresh boost to the trump fiscal agenda and as investors awaited earnings reports from companies including kellogg and chesapeake. futures on the s&p 500 index expiring in june climbed 0.3 percent ot 6.75 to 2.390 at 6:40 am in new york. the benchmark hasn’t posted gains or losses exceeding 0.2% for six straight sessions, and has struggled to top a record last seen on march 1. contracts on the dow jones industrial average added 52 points to 20,931 on thursday. at the end of its two-day meeting, the fed kept its benchmark interest rate steady, as expected, but downplayed weak first-quarter economic growth and emphasized the strength of the labor market, a sign it was still on track for two more rate increases this year. futures traders are now pricing in a 72 percent chance of a june rate hike, from 63 percent before the fed's statement, according to the cme group's fedwatch tool. attention now turns to u.s. non-farm payrolls for march, due on friday, after separate data showed private employers added 177,000 jobs in april. that was higher than expected but the smallest increase since october. after the dollar had risen across the board after the fed's meeting on wednesday, the dollar index which measures it against the top six world currencies, was modestly lower, erasing some gains. it was, however, well higher at 113.00 yen. the euro meanwhile drew some support from macron's performance ahead of sunday's election run-off, and was barely budged at $1.0876. in commodities, oil fell for a third session in four to leave it near its lowest since late march at $50.50 after the china services wobble and supply data had shown a smaller than expected decline in u.s. inventories. bellwether industrial metal copper was also teetering near a four month low on what traders said was china-based selling and on expectations that two u.s. rate rises this year could curb interest in dollar-denominated metals. iron-ore futures slid 5.3 percent. copper futures dropped 0.4 percent extending wednesday’s worst tumble since 2015.  oil declined 0.7 percent to $47.46 a barrel. ""later today there is a mass of u.s. data including key employment numbers, durable goods and factory orders and if these also fall below expectations it would be reasonable to expect another wave of selling,"" kingdom futures said in a note. occidental, regeneron, activision blizzard among companies reporting earnings. factory orders and durable goods orders due. u.s. markets bulletin headline summary market snapshot top overnight news asian equity markets traded mostly lower after weakness across the commodities complex and as participants digested the latest fomc which spurred expectations for a june hike. asx 200 (-0.5%) declined as materials names felt the brunt of the losses in the metals complex, while shanghai comp. (-0.3%) and hang seng (-0.4%) were pressured as commodity prices in china slumped in which dalian iron ore futures hit limit down shortly after the open. downside was also attributed to recent deleveraging in shadow banking, an increase in chinese short-term money market rates and after caixin services and composite pmi data fell to 11-month and 10-month lows respectively. however, heading into eu trade, the shanghai comp staged a modest recovery. as a reminder, japanese markets remained closed for greenery day. top asian news european bourses are higher this morning as price action has been dictated by the latest slew of large cap earnings. the energy sector outperforms amid gains seen in shell after they announced profits beat analyst estimates, however ftse 100 slightly lags its counterparts despite the upside in shell and hsbc shares, with the index hampered by the upside in gbp, while retail names slip following poor results from next. in fixed income markets, egbs trade lower amid the upside in equities, alongside the fall out of the fomc meeting last night, while various issuance from the likes of spain and france also kept prices subdued with bund lower by 45 ticks. elsewhere, the german/french spread is tighter after polls suggested macron produced a stronger performance than le pen in the tv presidential debate. the french presidential candidates conducted a live tv debate in which macron was seen to have performed better, as an elabe poll showed that 63% thought macron won the debate vs. 34% for le pen with the rest undecided. top european news in currencies, the bloomberg dollar spot index fell 0.1 percent as of 10:33 a.m. in london, after gaining 0.4 percent wednesday. it weakened against all but two of its group of 10 peers; the euro added 0.4 percent to $1.0927, while the pound gained 0.3 percent; the yen lost 0.1 percent to 112.75 per dollar. it has been a choppy session seen in fx this morning, and we can assume the modest excitement in the aftermath of the fomc statement release has played out. the usd saw a very modest rally after traders focused on the pricing for a jun hike on what was effectively a `stand pat' on policy, with the rate path still leaving room for 1 or 2 rate hikes this year. usd/jpy continues to run into resistance ahead of 113.00, and as yellen and co continually reiterate, constant data monitoring will determine the pace of rate move. as such, we may need a healthy jobs report tomorrow to see a sustained move above the figure, with techs pointing to resistance circa 113.25-30. usd/chf has been notably quiet. eur/usd is where the bulk of action is going through, and we see little sign of any defensive positioning ahead of this weekend's election run off in france. indeed, the market is still pushing for a move on 1.0950, as traders seen keen to take advantage of any gap should macron win this weekend as the polls are suggesting, and a little more so in the wake of last night's tv debate. in commodities, further losses in copper today to the detriment of the aud, but the 2017 range is still intact as the lower band at usd2.50-45 holds for now. no disputing that the china pmis have been a major contributor to this weakness, and to metals across the board, whilst supply concerns have been a constant weight through the year so far. this has also been an issue dampening oil prices, where we now see brent testing the usd50.000 mark, while wti grapples with range traders coming in ahead of usd47.00 amid hopes of a production cut extension into h1 as opec and non opec members have been talking of late. safe haven demand for gold is minimal and this is all down to the heightened expectations/polls pointing to a macron win this weekend. if he does, then gold heads lower still. we have dipped under usd1235 this morning. silver holding above mid usd16.00's after recent slide. looking at today’s calendar, we’ll get a first look at the q1 nonfarm productivity and unit labour costs data, as well as the latest weekly initial jobless claims print, march trade balance, march factory orders and final revisions to the march durable and capital goods orders data. away from the data there are a number of ecb speakers on the cards for today including president draghi at 4.30pm bst when he is due to speak in switzerland. lautenschlaeger, praet and mersch are also due. away from this, uk local elections are scheduled today with polls closing at 10pm bst. we should have an idea of some of the results early tomorrow morning and they are worth keeping an eye given the proximity to next month’s general election. earnings wise today the headliners are ab inbev, bmw and shell. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap on your long but fulfilling db powered commute this morning the main stories overnight revolve around the fomc, the final french presidential tv debate and plans to avoid the imminent potential us government shutdown. overnight we can also report the breaking news that house republicans will today vote on the gop health care bill. majority leader kevin mccarthy said that the republican bill will have the votes required to push through so we’ll see how that goes today. in terms of the fed yesterday, as expected there were no real surprises to come from the decision to keep rates unchanged or out of the post meeting fomc statement but there was just about enough for the market to ramp up the odds for another tightening next month. indeed bloomberg’s calculator (which overstates a little) now has the probability of a hike at 90% which compares to 67% this time yesterday. with regards to the statement itself the fomc acknowledged the soft quarter for growth in q1 and also softness in consumer spending but also emphasised the need to look through it and that the slowdown is likely to be transitory. there was a reference to fundamentals underpinning consumer spending remaining solid and the committee generally sounded more upbeat on business fixed investment. on the labour market the fed said that job gains were solid in recent months. the committee also acknowledged the drop in core inflation in march and that while market-based measures of inflation compensation remain lower, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed on balance. so all-in-all more of the same. tomorrow’s fedspeak could well be more interesting particularly for any snippets around the balance sheet. for now our us economists continue to expect the next rate hike to come in june with high conviction for this view. a few hours after the fed and post the us close we then learned that the house had finally approved a $1.17tn spending bill by a majority of 309-118 votes, moving a step closer to avoiding a government shutdown this saturday. the bill will now pass over to the senate where it is expected that a vote will be held today. according to the wsj the bill supposedly excluded a number of trump’s top priorities including a smaller than expected increase in military spending. the other main event after the us close was the live french presidential debate which finished up at 10.30pm bst last night having been going for about 2 hours. in terms of the outcome a snap elabe poll out just after the debate showed that macron won by a score of 63% to 34% over le pen. as expected there were the usual fiery exchanges but nothing that really moved the dial. instead the general feeling was that macron solidified his position and lead. le pen was questioned intensely about her plans for a dual-currency regime for the franc and euro while the ft also summarised that macron focused routinely on the contradictions and inaccuracies in le pen’s plan to exit the eu. le pen on the other hand spent a great deal of time portraying macron as an elitist. the euro traded in a tight range through much of the debate and finished up little changed compared to where it was when the debate started. with regards to markets yesterday, in what was another otherwise subdued day of price action, the most notable moves came in treasuries following the fomc. 2y and 10y yields ended the day up +3.6bps and +3.8ps respectively, although 30y yields ended up little changed with the us treasury borrowing committee warning against possible issuance of long-dated bonds. the greenback also firmed up with the dollar index up about +0.45% versus this time yesterday. gold and silver sold off -1.48% and -2.14% respectively. meanwhile price action in us equities remains incredibly dull. the s&p 500 did recover from apple-driven heavier losses at the open but still finished down a small -0.13%. to put it in perspective the last six daily closing changes for the s&p have been -0.13%, +0.12%, +0.17%, -0.19%, +0.06% and -0.05%. it wasn’t much more exciting in europe yesterday where the stoxx 600 closed -0.04%. european credit did outperform however led by financials with senior and sub fins itraxx indices ending 1bp and 7.5bps tighter respectively. one asset class which did see a decent move yesterday was base metals with copper (-3.48%) in particular suffering its biggest-one day decline since 2015 following bearish stockpiles data. that weakness in commodities coupled with further softening data in china this morning has seen most bourses in asia edge lower in the early going. as we go to print the hang seng (-0.52%), shanghai comp (-0.25%) and asx (-0.52%) are all in the red, although the kospi (+0.57%) has gone against the grain. on that data, china’s caixin services pmi in april declined 0.7pts to 51.5 which has left the composite reading at 51.2 versus 52.1 in march. the aussie dollar is also weaker this morning with the moves in commodities. moving on. in terms of the economic data in the us yesterday the april adp print came in more or less in line with the consensus at 177k (vs. 175k expected). that follows a slightly downwardly revised 255k in march. it’s worth adding that the consensus for friday’s nfp is hovering around 190k at present. away from that the headline ism non-manufacturing for april rose a solid 2.3pts to 57.5 (vs. 55.8) which is a smidgen below the ytd high made in february. at the same time the services pmi was also revised up 0.6pts to 53.1. interestingly in the details of the ism, the new orders component rose to a new 12-year  high of 63.2 however the employment component edged down another 0.2pts to a fairly low 51.4. remember also that the employment component in the ism manufacturing softened so that may sound some caution ahead of payrolls. in europe yesterday the main report of note was the q1 gdp print for the euro area which revealed that the economy grew +0.5% qoq in q1 which was in line with the market and one-tenth ahead of what our european team had pegged. away from that, ppi in the euro area was reported as falling -0.3% mom in march, while unemployment in germany held steady at 5.8% in april. before we look at the day ahead its worth noting that yesterday puerto rico officially filed for protection from its creditors in what is being called by numerous press outlets the largest debt restructuring filing by a local government or us state ever. according to bloomberg the debt amount is around $74bn which the commonwealth is asking a federal court to force creditors to take losses on. looking at today’s calendar, this morning in europe the main focus will be on the final april pmi revisions where we’ll get the services and composite readings and also a first look at the data for the uk and periphery. also due out this morning is money and credit aggregates data for the uk for march, and retail sales data for the euro area. in the us this afternoon we’ll get a first look at the q1 nonfarm productivity and unit labour costs data, as well as the latest weekly initial jobless claims print, march trade balance, march factory orders and final revisions to the march durable and capital goods orders data. away from the data there are a number of ecb speakers on the cards for today including president draghi at 4.30pm bst when he is due to speak in switzerland. lautenschlaeger, praet and mersch are also due. away from this, uk local elections are scheduled today with polls closing at 10pm bst. we should have an idea of some of the results early tomorrow

the dollar may be prone for a selloff: ""t he elevated payrolls forecast is partly a function of presumed seasonality and payback, but insomuch as this points to investor willingness to shrug off recent weaker indicators, this points to potential for usd-negative disappointment "" first, here is citi's todd elmer: fed on autopilot today’s policy statement is unlikely to drive many ripples in the market, so the likelihood is that we will continue to see broadly range bound trade until the heavier hitting events later this week. specifically, speeches by fed vice-chairman fischer on monetary policy and other fed officials, as well as the payrolls release are far more likely catalysts for moves in fx . the former provides more freedom for the fed to offer nuanced shifts on forward guidance than is possible in the constrained policy statement, while the latter will be seen as a key marker on whether or not the recent soft patch in data flow is extending. for the fed’s part, the policy statement hits slightly hawkish notes. the expectation is that recent slowing will be ‘transitory’ and there is acknowledgement of improved labor data. this should reinforce the view that recent developments are unlikely to interrupt the fed from its measured tightening, but provide little to prod the market to price in a faster pace of tightening beyond june . the forward guidance was unchanged. this means that pass through to fx is likely to be limited. indeed, if anything the knee-jerk response to the statement saw usd selling. while this very modest move has since unwound, this suggests that market lean was not quite as dovish as recent softer data flow might suggest . the forward looking implications are two-fold: 1) it may take a much more significant shift in signals from the fed either on rates or the balance sheet to see investors add to expected tightening in the quarters ahead. with limited incentive for the fed to induce such a move, we doubt that this factor will offer usd much support for the time being. 2) this may denote a more hawkish lean into the data later this week. the elevated payrolls forecast is partly a function of presumed seasonality and payback, but insomuch as this points to investor willingness to shrug off recent weaker indicators, this points to potential for usd-negative disappointment. and bmo's ian lyngen: fomc statement shows committee is still viewing the economy as “just fine” and a rate hike in june is still possible, bmo strategist ian lyngen writes in note. changes from previous statement in line with expectations “treasuries are only modestly weaker in the wake of the fed, in line with the interpretation that very little was said and the big story of the day remains the lower odds of an ultra-long bond” finally, here's goldman's jan hatzius: 1. the fomc maintained the funds rate target range at 0.75-1 percent at its may meeting, as widely expected. the post-meeting statement acknowledged but downplayed weak gdp growth in q1, noting that it expects the slowdown to be “transitory.” similarly, the statement downgraded the description of consumption growth, noting that it “rose only modestly,” but noted that the fundamentals “remained solid.” in addition, the statement upgraded the description of business investment mildly. on the labor market, the fomc looked through recent volatility to note that job gains have been solid “on average” and also noted the decline in the unemployment rate. on inflation, the statement acknowledged the decline in consumer prices in march, but noted that headline inflation was “running” instead of “moving” close to the 2% target on a 12-month basis. 2. the statement made no change to the description of the balance of risks, which remained “roughly balanced,” or the stance of monetary policy, which remained “accommodative.” finally, the statement made no changes to the discussion of balance sheet policy. there were no dissents. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Volatility Jan Hatzius Monetary Policy Unemployment Consumer Prices,1

2554,"Chris Whalen: ""The Dollar Super-Cycle Ends""",2017-05-03 18:02:00+00:00,"authored by chris whalen via institutionalriskanalyst.com, what do the us residential housing market, the stock market and the dollar all have in common? all of these markets represent bubbles created and driven by the aggressive social engineering of the federal open market committee. we live in an age of asset bubbles rather than true economic  growth. the investment world is skewed by the latest round of monetary policy experimentation by the fed, including years of artificially low interest rates and trillions of dollars in “massive asset purchases,” to paraphrase former fed chairman ben bernanke. these bubbles are caused and magnified by supply constraints, not an abundance of credit. whether you look at us stocks, residential homes in san francisco or the dollar, the picture that emerges is a market that has risen sharply, far more than the underlying rate of economic growth, due to a constraint in the supply of assets and a relative torrent of cash chasing the available opportunities. likewise with the dollar, the image of the financial markets is one of constraints rather than policy ease. since the middle of 2014, the value of the dollar against major currencies has risen sharply, suggesting a shortage of liquidity or at least a relative preference for dollars vs other fiat currencies. the vast flow of foreign direct investment drawn into the us and then into asset classes like residential and commercial real estate illustrates the abundance of global dollar liquidity and relatively scarcity of assets. even with the supposedly accommodative policy by the fomc, key measures of market liquidity continue to suggest either price and/or structural constraints, both in the us and overseas. looking at the effective cost of dollar credit, for example, illustrated by the notorious london interbank offered rate or libor, the cost of borrowing dollars in europe has risen steadily risen since the middle of 2015. again, the chart below makes us wonder if the good folks on the fomc appreciate the degree of fundamental demand for dollar credit. with the end of the mortgage bankers secondary market conference in new york, american lenders face a market with new origination volumes down 25-30%. meanwhile, the reinvestment of prepayments on $1.7 trillion worth of mortgage backed securities (mbs) held by the fomc is essentially taking up new bond issuance by fannie, freddie and ginnie combined. we have been on the record saying that the fomc should adjust its portfolio now to accommodate private market demand for yield.  and there is no need for actual sales. simply ending the fed’s reinvestment of mortgage bond prepayments would allow the interest rate markets to find a natural level and, to us, give the fed a more accurate picture of demand upon which to adjust supply. ""i think they're aiming for something in the vicinity of $2.3 to $2.8 trillion, something like that,"" former fed chair ben bernanke said monday on cnbc's ""squawk box."" ending reinvestment of the fed’s mbs portfolio would lead to a net monthly runoff rate in high double digit billions of dollars. or to put it another way, it is time for the fomc to get out of the way of the private market. shrink  the fed’s bond portfolio and credit the reserve accounts of the banks. it seems that many market indicators such as the dollar and libor suggest a market that is either schizophrenic or dysfunctional. our guess is the latter , in part due to excessive prescription-based regulation of traditional banking and finance, particularly low-margin money market businesses which are being abandoned by the big depositories like jpmorgan (nyse:jpm) and the bank of new york mellon (nyse:bk). there are seismic changes going on in the world of trading cash securities and collateral lending, changes that see a host of non-banking firms returning to this traditional nonbank space. staring at these charts for the dollar and libor, we wonder how much of the upward price movement is caused by legal and regulatory changes occurring over the same periods. the clear question from all of this: what happens when this latest dollar super cycle ends? given that zero or negative rates elsewhere are driving much of the emigration into american assets, why should the dollar ever selloff, right? regards the prospect of a dollar drop, megan greene tells us on twitter that “only way i see it in the short-run is if everyone else gets in trouble and the fed opens swap lines w other cbs to supply qe #unlikely"" we hear all of that, but can’t help but ask the question. all things do come to an end, including the seeming ability of the fomc to painlessly levitate the fortunes of heavily indebted nations on a sea of easy dollar credit. this works really well when the dollar is strong, otherwise not so much. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Ben Bernanke LIBOR Commercial Real Estate Chris Whalen Ben Bernanke Twitter Monetary Policy Bond Mortgage Backed Securities Bank of New York Housing Market Real estate Twitter,1
2558,FOMC Preview: Here Are The Possible Surprises In Today's Statement,2017-05-03 16:47:00+00:00,"today's fomc announcement at 2:00pm is expected to be mostly a non-event, and the only incremental information will be what is contained in the updated statement, which comes one month ahead of the fed's next expected rate hike in june. there will be no press conference and no update to the summary of economic projections. the statement is expected to incorporate modest changes to reflect recent (mixed) data but see the risks around the meeting are low. here is what wall street consensus looks like ahead of 2pm: continuing the trend from recent weeks, most wall street firms expect the fed to hike twice more this year despite the recent slowdown in us economic indicators and the near record collapse in the citi eco surprise index, in june and september and announce balance sheet reduction in december. with that in mind, below are some observations from citigroup on the few surprises in the ""wording"" contained in today's statement: fomc “looking through” weak q1 may read slightly hawkish the statement will need to update language regarding inflation, consumption, and job growth – all of which have slowed since the march meeting. the relative hawkishness depends on the extent to which fed officials attribute the softness to transitory factors. consumer spending – spending slowed significantly in january and february. the consensus view (reflected in march fomc minutes) is that much of the weakness is transitory owing to (1) less utilities usage due to warm weather and (2) delayed tax refunds. march: ""household spending has continued to rise moderately"" * * * inflation – a surprise decline in core prices in march led core pce to print 1.6% year-on-year undoing most of the progress since 2016. some update of the inflation language is in order. march: ""inflation has increased in recent quarters, moving close to the committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent."" * * * labor market – going into the march fomc meeting the economy had added over 200k jobs in each of the previous two months. the last job print of 98k was widely attributed to payback from previously warm weather. march: ""job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months."" * * * balance sheet – discussion of the timing and details of tapering of reinvestments will likely continue at the may meeting. assuming tapering is announced in december, the committee may wait until at least june and more likely september before adjusting language in the statement regarding the balance sheet. the minutes to be released on may 24 will likely be more informative on this point. * * * and here is goldman's full list of exepctations for today's statement: 1. constructive comments on full-year growth. despite the 0.7% increase reported in this morning’s q1 gdp report, we expect the fomc statement will continue to sound constructive on growth trends, repeating that “economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace”, or simply saying that activity “continued to expand.” underlying growth in the first quarter appears firmer than headline gdp would suggest, and fed officials including vice chair fischer have argued that growth is likely to be stronger during the remainder of the year. exhibit 1 summarizes this mixed but generally positive message from growth indicators, which featured some sequential slowing in payrolls growth and our current activity indicator (cai) but also a drop in the u3 and u6 unemployment rates as well as positive data surprises on net. relatedly, we expect an adjustment to the statement’s labor market characterization that acknowledges the pronounced drop in the unemployment rate, yet also softens the language around “solid” recent job gains (reflecting the slowdown in march headline payroll growth). we also expect the committee to downgrade its assessment of household spending (from “rise moderately” to “rise modestly”) and for the committee to remove the word “somewhat” in its characterization of firming business investment (i.e. “business investment appears to have firmed.”) 2. few changes to description of inflation-related data. the previous statement distinguished between headline- and core inflation, a distinction we expect the committee will retain. however, given the pronounced softness in the march core inflation report, the previous statement’s “little changed” characterization of core inflation would seem out of place. indeed, this morning's gdp report was consistent with core pce inflation at 1.6% in march (yoy), down from 1.7% in february. accordingly, we expect a brief acknowledgement of this softness (i.e. “core inflation slowed somewhat in march”). however, we expect the statement will retain the “continued to run somewhat below 2 percent” wording. also, the mid-april drop in market-based measures of inflation expectations largely reversed in the final week of the month, with 5y/5y breakeven inflation now back at the march levels (2.1%). as a result, we expect no changes to the inflation expectations wording. 3. and unchanged inflation outlook. despite the march setback, the drop in the march unemployment rate coupled with the committee’s apparent growth optimism suggest little need to modify the inflation outlook. we currently forecast core pce inflation to reach 2.0% in early 2018, which seems broadly consistent with the march statement’s expectation that “inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.” accordingly, we expect no changes to the inflation outlook paragraph. 4. unchanged balance of risks and “accommodative” policy description. at its june 2016 meeting, after concerns about the spillovers from brexit had faded, the fomc said in its statement: “near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.” the committee upgraded this language again at the september meeting, saying: “near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.” the qualifiers “near-term” and “roughly” suggest fed officials are less than fully confident about the outlook. however, we do not expect any changes to this section of the statement, as improving international growth trends are likely weighed against continued geopolitical risks and today’s softer 1q gdp data. a meaningful upgrade to the balance of risks should be taken as a hawkish signal for the near-term policy outlook, in our view. in terms of the assessment of the stance of current policy, committee members appear to use “accommodative” interchangeably with “modestly” or “moderately accommodative,” and we see little reason to qualify the “accommodative” characterization in next week’s statement – particularly because doing so would likely be interpreted as a dovish shift. 5. subtle reference to eventual balance sheet adjustment. we expect a minor change to the balance sheet paragraph, with some sort of allusion to possible eventual reductions. given the extent of the discussion in the minutes to the march fomc meeting – as well as several comments by fed officials over the last month about the fed’s plans for ending reinvestment – it would seem odd for the statement to omit any reference to the topic. at the same time, committee members will likely want to avoid signaling an imminent policy change. if the committee does edit this section, we expect the wording to be fairly vague and noncommittal. one possibility is that the committee adopts the “gradual and predictable” language from the march minutes as a description of its overarching balance sheet policy. 6. no explicit mention of fiscal policy. notwithstanding the wednesday tax announcement, the committee has gained little incremental clarity on the legislative outlook since the march meeting. furthermore, the fomc does not explicitly include the issue in the list of factors it will use to assess appropriate monetary policy (even though fiscal stimulus may be the single most important source of uncertainty for the economic outlook this year and next year.) the committee has mentioned fiscal policy in past statements, but only after-the-fact in recent years. for example, statements in 2009 referred to “fiscal and monetary stimulus”, while those in 2013 said that “fiscal policy is restraining economic growth”. a similar approach seems likely this time around, with fiscal policy only discussed in the statement after legislation begins to affect the economy. 7. no dissents. minneapolis fed president neel kashkari dissented against the march hike, but dovish dissents seem very unlikely given our expectation that rates will be left unchanged. we also do not expect any hawkish dissents, in part because a pause at this meeting would still be consistent with as many as four hikes over the course of 2017 that could be achieved in the three remaining press conference meetings. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [

2573,"Global Stocks Dip On Poor US Auto Sales, Apple Miss; Fed Decision On Deck",2017-05-03 11:42:00+00:00,"european, asian stocks and s&p futures all fall as investors digested poor overnight news on apple earnings and u.s. car sales, while the dollar rose in muted trading as investors contemplated chances of another rate hike next month ahead of today's federal reserve statement. europe's stoxx 600 fell from a 20 month high as traders sold risk after poor earnings from apple and a 4th consecutive month of declining u.s. car sales, while the dollar strengthened before a federal reserve meeting where policy makers will need to mull over another soft patch in the u.s. economy. european apple suppliers were among the biggest losers in the broader stoxx 600 index, with dialog semiconductor dropping as much as 6.2% before recovering losses. poor april auto sales in turn hit industrial metals which pushed commodity producers for a third day. falls in the price of copper, iron ore and other metals also underlined growing nerves over china and, with oil prices stuck near recent lows, weighed on europe's commodity-heavy indices. ""these numbers point to u.s. consumers becoming more cautious and do seem like a source of some of the weakness today,"" said andy sullivan, a portfolio manager with gl asset management uk in london. ""autos, tech and basic resources are leading europe lower."" a bond rally in peripheral europe was led by italy while closed markets in japan, south korea and hong kong limited trading in treasuries, which weakened at the start of european hours. and then there is today's fed statement. as a reminder, markets now price in a 60% probability of a june rate hike, however weak u.s. economic numbers in the past month have cast some doubt on this. as a result, traders will be keenly looking at hints by yellen whether the recent bout of economic weakness will be seen by the fed as merely temporary. according to db, there is unlikely to be much new information in this month’s fomc statement. db’s peter hooper believes that the risk, albeit a small one, is that they will come closer to moving in a tightening direction than currently expected. more will be learned on that score in post-meeting fedspeak (for which there are a number of speakers due on friday including fed chair yellen) or the minutes to the meeting. in terms of the finer details, peter highlights that the committee should be able to get away with relatively minor changes in the discussion of recent developments. they can acknowledge the soft gdp print and consumer spending in particular . that said they should also downplay this softness given the known issues with seasonality. on the inflation front, indicators have trended modestly higher on balance, notwithstanding a softening in core inflation in march driven by the anomalous drop in mobile phone services prices. the yoy change in the core pce price index was running just modestly below the committee’s 2% objective through q1. an up-drift in most measures of wage inflation over the past couple of years confirm that the labor market has been in the vicinity of full employment for a while now. market measures of inflation expectations have eased on balance since the march fomc meeting, though they have rebounded recently. in summary, with market expectations for a june hike running at 67% according to bloomberg’s calculator (and just 13% for a may hike) there will probably not be a need to push these expectations higher at this point. but any net changes in the statement are more likely to be read as hawkish rather than dovish, simply because the current and near-term prospective mix of economic developments probably moves them closer to their next rate hike, which db expects will be in june back to markets, where after a mixed asian session, with japan, skorea and hk closed, the msci global share index was marginally lower on the day. satoshi okagawa, senior global markets analyst for sumitomo mitsui banking corporation in singapore, said the weak u.s. auto sales could make market participants wary of actively buying the dollar against the yen for now. ""concerns about geopolitical risks such as north korea had weighed on the dollar against the yen recently ... but the focus is shifting to whether the (strength) of u.s. economic fundamentals is for real,"" he said. ""there is more data coming up including the jobs data, so those need to be watched closely,"" okagawa said, referring to the u.s. nonfarm payrolls report due on friday. euro stoxx 600 fell 0.2 percent as of 10:37 a.m. in london, with losses led by miners; futures on the nasdaq 100 gained 0.1 percent. s&p 500 futures retreated 0.2% after the underlying gauge rose 0.1% tuesday. the bloomberg dollar spot index rose, reversing tuesday’s fall, as traders covered some shorts in the currency even though options suggested the federal reserve policy decision will fail to excite markets. bloomberg notes that amid low volumes and below-average liquidity with japan closed for holidays, fast-money accounts were seen cutting part of their dollar-short positioning in the london session, according to foreign-exchange traders in the region. investors expect marginal language shifts, if any, by the fed and an unwillingness to commit to a june hike. tier-one data out of the u.s. are to be released in the weeks ahead, including employment and inflation figures, which makes a case for policy makers to adopt a fully flexible approach. options reflect subdued expectations on the federal open market committee decision and communique: overnight volatility in euro-dollar peaked earlier at 12.41 percent, the second-lowest reading on any announcement day since 2016 meanwhile wti rebounded overnight, as futures bounced back from lowest level in 6 weeks. brent also gained trading around $51after russia said to back extension to output cuts. yesterday's api data are “keeping a bid in the market as we await confirmation of these numbers,” said jens pedersen, senior analyst at danske bank. “there had been bearish sentiment as the market has become a bit more concerned about the extension of cuts” as a reminder, api reported inventories down 4.16mmbbl, with gasoline 1.93mm barrels lower. carlyle, estee lauder, humana are among companies reporting earnings. the main event is the fed's rate announcement at 2pm; there is no yellen press conference this month. market snapshot top overnight news asian markets traded mixed ahead of the looming key risk events including the fomc meeting and amid several market closures with japanese, south korean and hong kong markets shut for public holiday. asx 200 (-0.9%) declined below the 5,900 level with telecoms weighed on by vocus, while miners also slipped as copper prices remained pressured. the shanghai comp. (-0.3%) failed to benefit from a firm cny 200bin pboc liquidity injection and the taiex gained with the apple supply chain mostly higher following the tech giant's earning release, where q2 eps beat expectations but revenue and iphone sales disappointed. pboc injected cny 170bin in 7-day reverse repos, cny2obln in 14-day reverse repos and cny 10bin in 28-day reverse repos. top asia news in

bourses are trading modestly in the red with the main headline this morning focusing on reports from the ft that the brexit bill may be around eur 100bn, according to their calculations. while uk brexit minister davis has been quick to state that the uk would not have to pay the bill if they do not reach an agreement with the eu, subsequently adding further uncertainty to how the brexit negotiations will take place. however, the ftse has been somewhat undeterred by these latest reports. fixed income markets have been on the front foot with ftq flow keeping prices afloat, oats are relatively flat with yields trickling down by 0.4bps ahead of tonight's french presidential tv debate. top european news in currencies, fx liquidity has not at its best based on the price action seen this morning. gbp has been in focus given the latest rhetoric from the eu 27, who have now banned theresa may from head of state meetings. the hard-line stance relates to the settling of the exit bills, where some of the numbers have been pumped in the media, but early gbp selling has been reversed. cable dipped under 1.2900 but held the tuesday lows, while eur/gbp has been contained by 0.8435-80. construction pmis in the uk also beat forecasts, but key services sector due tomorrow. eu growth data matched expectations to underline the steady recovery alluded to by ecb president draghi last week. no major impact as yet as french politics takes over the focus, and to that end, sellers ahead of 1.0950 contain the spot rate, but sub 1.0900 bids also banking on a macron victory as the polls (so far) suggest. a large 1.0925 expiry today is also helping to steady the ship. usd/jpy has traded a very quiet range above 112.00, but this is likely to change after the adp private jobs survey later on today. us treasury yields have taken a modest dip, though brushed off by fx markets as yet. in commodities, it is proving a little more volatile in the commodities market of late, and with oil prices dominating in recent sessions, it has been copper taking a hit. various factors cited, with some pointing to the weaker china manufacturing pmis, but the timing of the hit suggests weak us auto car sales would have been more of a factor . price now eyeing a move towards the range lows for 2017, but still comfortably off usd2.50 as yet. oil traders still testing lower levels, and this was in light of the higher than expected draw down on crude inventory. apis are pretty erratic however, and pressure likely to continue unless the data is underlined by the eia later today. wti resistance ahead of usd50.00 has been a factor, but this level also support for brent. precious metals still basing out, but we may see some upside going into the weekend and the second round vote in france. looking at the day ahead, in the us the early focus will be on the april adp employment change print which will be closely watched ahead of payrolls on friday. the consensus is for a 175k reading while our us team are forecasting 200k. also due out are the final pmi revisions (services and composite) and the ism non-manufacturing print. thereafter all eyes turn over to the fomc meeting in the evening. away from the data, the ecb’s hansson is due to speak around lunchtime today, while the eu’s barnier is also due to brief press on brexit talks in brussels this morning. this evening we have the decisive french presidential debate. earnings wise today we’ve got 33 s&p 500 companies scheduled to report including kraft heinz, facebook and time warner. bnp paribas and volkswagen also report in europe. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap this week is still yet to really kick into gear although there is the potential for things to get a bit more interesting tonight when we first get the outcome of the fomc meeting, before following that up with a head to head battle between french presidential candidates macron and le pen when they face-off in a live televised debate. with regards to the fed the general feeling is that there is unlikely to be much new information in this month’s fomc statement. db’s peter hooper believes that the risk, albeit a small one, is that they will come closer to moving in a tightening direction than currently expected. more will be learned on that score in post-meeting fedspeak (for which there are a number of speakers due on friday including fed chair yellen) or the minutes to the meeting. in terms of the finer details, peter highlights that the committee should be able to get away with relatively minor changes in the discussion of recent developments. they can acknowledge the soft gdp print and consumer spending in particular. that said they should also downplay this softness given the known issues with seasonality. on the inflation front, indicators have trended modestly higher on balance, notwithstanding a softening in core inflation in march driven by the anomalous drop in mobile phone services prices. the yoy change in the core pce price index was running just modestly below the committee’s 2% objective through q1. an up-drift in most measures of wage inflation over the past couple of years confirm that the labor market has been in the vicinity of full employment for a while now. market measures of inflation expectations have eased on balance since the march fomc meeting, though they have rebounded recently. in summary, with market expectations for a june hike running at 67% according to bloomberg’s calculator (and just 13% for a may hike) there will probably not be a need to push these expectations higher at this point. but any net changes in the  statement are more likely to be read as hawkish rather than dovish, simply because the current and near-term prospective mix of economic developments probably moves them closer to their next rate hike, which db expects will be in june. over in france the polls continue to heavily favour macron over le pen in recent days with the average lead from the last 5 polls still at 20pp. some of the press reports in the last 24 hours or so have been on le pen seemingly trying to downplay her anti-euro message with the ft in particular running such a story so it’ll be interesting if this comes out at all tonight. as noted at the top tonight’s debate is live and televised once again and is due to kick off at 9pm cet (8pm bst). over in markets yesterday it was another fairly uneventful session on wall street with the s&p 500 (+0.12%) eking out another modest gain. this came after european bourses returned from the long weekend in a good mood as evidenced by the +0.75% gain for the stoxx 600. developments in greece seemed to be a big factor behind the positive sentiment after the country came to an agreement with creditors on reforms needed to unlock the next disbursement tranche of emergency loans. the deal came about following a long night of talks with greece eventually backing down on aggressive pension cuts, dropping  the minimum income tax threshold and liberalising sunday trade amongst other things. greece pm tsipras will now need to pass everything through parliament while the imf and europeans will also now have to come to an agreement on debt relief measures. unsurprisingly greek assets rallied pretty hard yesterday. the athex finished up +3.06% while 10y greek yields were 32bps lower by the end of play. similar maturity bunds on the other hand were 1bp higher at 0.324%. away from this, there wasn’t much new to report on the politics front in the us. president trump used twitter to say that “our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in september to fix mess!” but the market was little moved. 10y treasury yields perfectly reversed monday’s move to finish 3.8bps lower at 2.281% with the only data release being a non-eventful april auto sales print (16.8m vs. 17.1m expected). oil may have played a factor in the move for treasury yields however after wti dipped -2.42% and back below $48/bbl. it has however rebounded about 1% overnight after the api report showed a drop in gasoline and crude stockpiles. another mover after the us close last night was apple after shares dipped 2% in extended trading following its q2 earnings report. while earnings were marginally ahead of bloomberg consensus, revenues missed on lower iphone sales and q3 revenue guidance was set at $43.5bn-$45.5bn which was also seen as disappointing compared to expectations for $45.7bn. apple did announce an increase to their capital return program but that wasn’t enough to stop shares falling and we’re seeing nasdaq futures down -0.30% in the early going too this morning. meanwhile in asia it’s another holiday-disrupted session with only bourses in china and australia open. both are weaker as we go to print with the shanghai comp down -0.22% and asx -1.01%. moving on. the main focus of yesterday’s data was the final revisions to the european manufacturing pmis. at a headline level the final reading for the euro area was revised down one-tenth to 56.7. all told that leaves the reading up 0.5pts versus march and also at the highest in six years. germany and france were unrevised at 58.2 and 55.1 respectively. meanwhile italy recorded a 73-month high at 56.2 (vs. 56.0 expected), spain a 2-month high at 54.5 (vs. 54.4 expected) and ireland a 3-month high at 55.0. the uk also came in at a much better than expected 57.3 (vs. 54.0 expected) which was an increase of 2.9pts versus march and the highest level in 3 years. also yesterday we thought that we would get greater clarity from the ecb in terms of the cspp/pspp taper ratio. however the numbers are yet to be conclusive even if they hint at tapering in both but with slightly less tapering in cspp. last week's cspp net purchases dropped to €1.2bn from €1.5bn a week earlier and €1.7bn the week before whereas pspp net purchases went up to €14.1bn from €11.1bn and €12.5bn, respectively. so the last week of the month's data has balanced the data a bit after what looked like at one point a more aggrieved pspp taper over cspp. michal jezek in my team has published a note overnight updating the view and numbers on the cspp program and the recently ended boe equivalent. further, this ig update looks at credit repricing following the first round of french presidential elections, including a focus on the relative performance of french credit. email him ( michal.jezek@db.com ) if you didn't receive a copy. looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe the early data release is from germany where the april unemployment stats are due out. shortly following that we’ll get the advance release of q1 gdp for the euro area, the consensus for which is pegged at +0.5% qoq. the euro area ppi report is also due out this morning. this afternoon in the us the early focus will be on the april adp employment change print which will be closely watched ahead of payrolls on friday. the consensus is for a 175k reading while our us team are forecasting 200k. also due out across the pond are the final pmi revisions (services and composite) and the ism non-manufacturing print. thereafter all eyes turn over to the fomc meeting in the evening. away from the data, the ecb’s hansson is due to speak around lunchtime today, while the eu’s barnier is also due to brief press on brexit talks in brussels this morning. this evening we then have the aforementioned french presidential debate. earnings wise today we’ve got 33 s&p 500 companies scheduled to report including kraft heinz, facebook and time warner. bnp paribas and volkswagen also report in europe. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com

2644,Central Banks Are Talking More Than Ever,2017-05-02 09:11:00+00:00,"authored by samuel rines via avalonadvisors.com, this note takes a brief look into ""narrative economics"" and the link to central banks. in the wake of the financial crisis, central banks have stepped up their communications, whether in the form of speeches, press conferences, or the like. while not a quantitative style of understanding economics, it may prove a useful tool to understanding broad shifts in the economy. robert shiller, in a discussion paper earlier this year, laid out the argument for economists paying closer attention to the ""narratives"" surrounding economics. to shiller, popular narratives drive more of the fundamental economic outcomes than economists are typically willing to admit. for example (one provided by shiller), the 1921 recession following the end of world war i was, in part, driven by narrative. in contrast to the typical explanation of why it occurred (a central banker went on a long vacation), there are more fundamental reasons for the downturn, including a 50% increase in the price of oil (with wide-spread fear that oil production would peak in a few years) and-probably the most important-deflation expectations. because consumers believed that prices would fall, they held back from making purchases. this was the era of the ""profiteer"", the word used to describe price gouging. thrift became a virtue, and there were calls to avoid buying anything other than the essentials. consumer spending plummetted, leading shiller to describe the recession as a ""consumer boycott"" lead by narrative, not by a traditional business cycle. while the example above is buried deep in history, there is applicability to the present. specifically, the rise in central bank communications. there have never been more speeches given by representatives of central banks than today. in a recent speech given by the chief economist of the bank of england andrew haldane ,  he calls for less complex and more accessible communication of monetary policy. ostensibly, this is to increase transparency and trust with the public and describe their actions and intentions to markets. being clear and transparent about the goals and sought after outcomes is a legitimate strategy being pursued by central banks around the world, the ""forward guidance"" policy tool. that is meant to build trust and utilize that trust to instruct outcomes. in some ways, build and maintain a narrative of economic conditions. this is where it becomes interesting for modern central bankers. first, it is not quite that simple to construct a narrative. note that the accessibility of monetary policy is low. the primary piece of material used by the fed to communicate its strategy, the fomc minutes, has an exceedingly low accessibility. this makes the communication outside of it far more important to the broader public and the maintenance of a given narrative. second, while the fed (or other central banks) may wish to control the economic narrative, it may not be capable of doing so. narratives, as pointed out by shiller, have a life of their own. what does this have to do with anything? one of the critical elements embedded within both the ""narrative economics"" theory and ""forward guidance"" is that the ability to avoid a repeat of a 1921 style, narrative driven retreat. it also shines a light on the need to carefully deconstruct popular narratives for their potential economic consequences. further, it points to the potential consequences of shifts in the efficacy of forward guidance from central banks. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Bank of England Monetary Policy Central Banks Transparency Recession Robert Shiller,1
2707,"Key Events In The Coming Busy Week: FOMC, Payrolls, 131 S&P Companies Report",2017-05-01 12:11:00+00:00,"besides the upcoming fomc meeting on may 2-3, and french & italian politics - the decisive runoff round of the french election takes place this sunday - this week's releases are dominated by us payrolls expected to come around 170k. the busy release calendar continues with norges bank and rba meetings as well as global manufacturing pmis. the market’s focus during the week of 5/1 will begin to shift away from the micro as the cq1 earnings season winds down and back to the macro w/a slew of eco data and some central bank decisions scheduled (including the fomc on wed 5/3 and us jobs on fri 5/5; also note that yellen is scheduled to speak fri after the jobs report at 1:30pmet). the eco data out this week could be crucial in helping to resolve the current debate around growth in the us, the data calendar will be very busy this week, highlighted by monday’s personal income and spending data (including the pce deflators) and friday’s april employment data. we expect solid income, modest spending, and relatively soft deflators, continuing the theme of very tame inflation data that we have seen over the past quarter. on employment, we expect a solid rebound in payroll growth following last month’s weather-induced disappointment and the overall tone will be consistent with the notion that the labor market is at or near full employment. specifically, we also expect that ahe will rise on trend and that the unemployment rate will be unchanged at 4.5%. rounding out the calendar, wall street expects modest declines in the ism indexes, though both will remain at solid outright levels, a bump in auto sales following the march swoon, and solid construction spending as well.. in addition, there are several scheduled speaking engagements by fed officials this week. fomc decision preview – the fed statement on wed (there won’t be a supplemental or yellen presser) is expected to be pretty innocuous. jpm believes the committee’s goal will be to acknowledge the softer run of data while still keeping june on the table as a live meeting. the bank continues to expect the fed to hike rates at the june meeting, but does not think the statement will send a strong signal of impending action. look for the statement to say that economic growth slowed early in the year, but to add that it is in part due to transitory factors. the second paragraph of the statement will continue to note that risks are roughly balanced. earnings preview - this week is another fairly big one for earnings with 131 s&p 500 companies and 85 stoxx 600 companies reporting. amongst the big names are apple (tuesday), bp (tuesday), facebook (wednesday) and shell (thursday). as jim reid notes, we’ll see if they can continue what has been a decent start to earnings season to date. indeed the trend so far is one of the strongest on record. in the us we have had reports from about 60% of the s&p 500 and 81% have beat at the earnings line, coming in 6.7% above consensus. this compares to the historical beat of 73% of companies and a median beat of 3.4%. this is made even more impressive by the fact that consensus estimates were not downgraded in the month leading up to earnings season compared to a typical 1% downgrade. he notes also that the results so far point to 15% eps growth in q1  which is the fastest pace since 2011. our european equity strategists note also that eps growth of stoxx 600 companies has accelerated to 23% with reported earnings being 13% above pre-season expectations. breakdown of key events by day from deutsche bank: on monday, with it being a public holiday in the uk, germany and france amongst other countries today, the main focus will be on the us session where there are a number of important releases include the pce core and deflator readings and personal income and spending reports for march, as well as the ism manufacturing reading for april and construction spending in march. tuesday kicks off in asia with the japan services and composite april pmis and caixin manufacturing pmi in china. over in europe all eyes will be on the final april manufacturing pmis as well as a first look at the data for the periphery and uk. the euro area unemployment rate will also be released. in the us tomorrow the only data due out is vehicle sales in april. kicking things off on wednesday will be germany where the april unemployment numbers are due to be released. shortly after that we’ll get euro area ppi for march and then the advanced q1 gdp report for the euro area. in the us on wednesday we’ll get the adp employment change report in april and the final april pmis and ism non-manufacturing reading. also on wednesday all eyes then turn over to the fed meeting. in asia on thursday the early data is out of china with the remaining april caixin pmis. in europe we’ll also get the remaining april services and composite pmis as well as euro area retail sales in march and uk money and credit aggregates data. in the us on thursday the data includes initial jobless claims, q1 nonfarm productivity and unit labour costs, march trade balance, march factory orders and the final revisions to march durable and capital goods orders. with little of note in europe on friday the main focus will be on the us where we’ll get the april employment report including nonfarm payrolls. away from the data, this week’s fedspeak is reserved for friday when we’ll hear separately from fischer, williams and yellen, as well as a panel debate with rosengren, evans and bullard. over at the ecb this week we are due to hear from nouy and nowotny on tuesday and lautenschlaeger, praet, draghi and mersch on thursday. at the boj we are due to hear from kuroda on tuesday, as well as receiving the minutes from the boj meeting last month. other important events this week include a fox interview with us treasury secretary steven mnuchin today, a meeting between germany’s merkel and russia’s putin on tuesday, wednesday’s live televised debate between french presidential candidates macron and le pen, wednesday’s meeting between president trump and palestinian authority president abbas and uk local elections on thursday. finally, expect earnings to also be a big focus for markets this week with 131 s&p 500 companies reporting and 85 stoxx 600 companies reporting. amongst those reporting are apple, bp, bnp paribas, facebook, merck, tesla, time warner, pfizer, hsbc, bmw, shell

2708,Futures Rise On Government Funding Deal; Most Global Markets Closed For Holiday,2017-05-01 11:41:00+00:00,"with much of europe and asia, including the u.k., france, germany and china markets closed for labor day, asian stocks and the dollar rose buoyed by news that congress had reached a deal to keep the us government funded through the end of september.  s&p futures are up 4 points or 0.2%. oil declined as rigs targeting crude in the u.s. rose for a fifteenth week and output from libya rebounded. what’s happening this morning? not a whole lot. the two big incremental headlines concerned china (the apr pmis were underwhelming) and us gov’t spending (as was widely expected a deal was reached to fund the gov’t until sept 30 although a shutdown this fall, along w/a debt ceiling battle, remain distinct possibilities). otherwise it was a relatively quiet weekend/morning. note that a lot of the world (other than the us) is closed mon 5/1 for labor day/may day holidays (including hk/mainland china and europe/london). the yen declined for a fifth day in six, while treasuries retreated with gold. the msci all country world index edged higher, after capping a sixth straight month of gains on friday. japan’s topix rose to the highest level since march after its best week of the year. trading volumes were lower than average due to holidays in most of europe, china, india and mexico, and a forthcoming three-day break in japan. msci's index of asia-pacific shares outside japan rose 0.1%. japan outperforming on upbeat earnings, with japan's nikkei climbing 0.4%, with high-tech blue chips gaining on strong earnings. asian shares initially took their cue from wall street, which dipped on friday after data showed the u.s. economy grew at its weakest pace in three years in the first quarter. the mood brightened however, on news that u.s. congressional negotiators hammered out a bipartisan agreement on a spending package to keep the federal government funded through sept. 30, thus averting a government shutdown. asian markets were little fazed by china's official manufacturing survey on sunday which showed growth in the country's factories slowed more than expected in april to a six-month low. pointing to a higher open for the main market later in the day, e-minis gained about 0.2% while 10-year treasury yields rose after three successive days of declines. ""it is hard for markets to make big moves with holidays in so many places today, and people are just waiting for more information to come out,"" said harumi taguchi, principal economist at ihs markit in tokyo. ""the main focus of the broader markets this week will be on the united states, with the fed's may 2-3 policy meeting and the jobs report on friday,"" said masahiro ichikawa, senior strategist at sumitomo mitsui asset management in tokyo. ""while many of the indicators in the first quarter were weak, the jobs data could confirm that labor market conditions continue to improve and lift the dollar and u.s. yields."" in currencies, the greenback was up 0.2 percent at 111.750 yen edging back towards a four-week peak of 111.780 reached last week. the euro handed back earlier modest gains and was flat at $1.0891. the common currency had been lifted on friday after euro zone inflation data rose more than expected and returned to the european central bank's target. the euro was still in range of the 5-1/2-month high of $1.0951 struck early last week on relief over the first round of the french presidential elections. the pound was 0.3 percent lower at $1.2907 after climbing to a seven-month high of $1.2957 on friday, when traders were seen to have closed off bets against the pound ahead of britain's long bank holiday weekend.  the australian and new zealand dollars were slightly lower at $0.7483 and $0.6856, respectively. in commodities, crude oil prices slipped amid lingering concerns that an opec-led production cut has failed to significantly tighten an oversupplied market.u.s. crude shed 11 cents to $49.22 a barrel, heading back towards a one-month low of $48.20 plumbed late last week and brent lcoc1 was down 16 cents at $51.89 per barrel. oil was weighed by news that us rigs targeting crude in the u.s. rose for 15th week while output from libya rebounded. the number of oil rigs operating in u.s. fields advanced to most since april 2015, according to baker hughes. libya’s crude production rebounded to more than 700k b/d as the opec member’s biggest oil field and another deposit in its western region resumed pumping after halt. “higher prices will attract american producers to ramp up production, especially in profitable areas like the permian basin, and the conflict in libya was already winding down last week,” says sheldon laliberte, a rotterdam-based crude oil analyst at commodities trader cofco international ltd. “i’m structurally bearish oil right now.” dish network, advanced micro devices, cardinal health among companies scheduled to publish results. it is another busy week for earnings with 131 s&p 500 companies reporting and 85 stoxx 600 companies reporting. amongst those reporting are apple, bp, bnp paribas, facebook, merck, tesla, time warner, pfizer, hsbc, bmw, shell and vw. market snapshot top overnight news from bloomberg most of asia was closed monday for holidays (hk, mainland china, taiwan, korea, india, and others, were closed). japan was open and saw decent gains (tpx +0.52%, nky +0.59%). australia also ended higher (+0.55%). news was quiet in asia other than some eco headlines – the china nbs apr pmis were mildly underwhelming while macau apr gaming revs and japan’s manufacturing pmi were both about inline. within the nky, tech was by far the top performer (the japanese info tech index ended up ~3.8%) while materials did well too (energy, discretionary, healthcare, and utilities lagged). tokyo electron and nippon electric glass both surged on earnings (up ~13.3% and ~11.7%, respectively); note that tokyo electron is just the latest pos. data point for semi equipment (semi equipment stocks have posted very healthy results). top asian news most european markets are closed due to the labor day/may 1 holiday. top european news in currencies, the yen fell as much as 0.4 percent to 111.92 per dollar to the lowest level since the end of march and traded at 111.74 in early morning trading. the currency last week had the biggest slide since the fed raised u.s. rates in december. the bloomberg dollar spot index added 0.1 percent, while the broader dollar dxy index was up 0.2 percent at 111.750 yen edging back towards a four-week peak of 111.780 reached last week. the euro handed back earlier modest gains and was flat at $1.0891. the common currency had been lifted on friday after euro zone inflation data rose more than expected and returned to the european central bank's target. the euro was still in range of the 5-1/2-month high of $1.0951 struck early last week on relief over the first round of the french

in libya was already winding down last week,” says sheldon laliberte, a rotterdam-based crude oil analyst at commodities trader cofco international ltd. “i’m structurally bearish oil right now.” us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap welcome to may. given that today is either a may day or labour day public holiday in most european countries we’ll be holding back the usual monthly performance review for tomorrow’s emr. as always though we’ve got the full run through of what is another reasonably busy week ahead at the end. for markets this week we’ve got the double header of a fed meeting on wednesday and us employment report on friday. barring a big surprise though it’s more than likely that the fed meeting is a bit of non-event and it’s hard to see the fomc statement really diverging off course for now. it’s worth noting that there is no scheduled press conference after the meeting either. in terms of payrolls, the emphasis for now in terms of the timing and pace of global hikes in recent months has shifted away from employment and over to inflation and so this release is probably less of a focal point than it has been in the past. away from that, this week we’ll also get the final revisions to the april global pmis which will be closely watched as always. meanwhile ahead of this sunday’s second round presidential election in france the two candidates, macron and le pen, are scheduled to take part in a live televised debate on wednesday evening which is certainly worth keeping an eye on. the last 5 polls all released in the past few days show macron as holding an average lead of 20pp over le pen. this is down marginally from the 24pp average in the first 5 polls after the first round result but still represents a pretty comfortable margin for macron. as we said this time last week it would take a numerical shock perhaps 5-10 times larger than brexit or trump for le pen to win. staying with politics, this week president trump is scheduled to meet palestinian authority president abbas on wednesday and australian prime minister turnbull on thursday. after congress averted a government shutdown on friday lawmakers are also expected to hammer out the necessary legislation this week to keep the government funded for the rest of this fiscal year. in fact overnight news has emerged that congress has tentatively reached a deal on a $1.1tn bill so worth seeing how that develops today. meanwhile the situation in north korea is never too far from the front pages with us national security adviser mcmaster telling fox news that the us and its allies need to respond, whether that be through military operations or enforcement of un sanctions, following the news of a ballistic missile launch in north korea on saturday. not to be outdone, this week is another fairly big one for earnings with 131 s&p 500 companies and 85 stoxx 600 companies reporting. amongst the big names are apple (tuesday), bp (tuesday), facebook (wednesday) and shell (thursday). we’ll see if they can continue what has been a decent start to earnings season to date. indeed the trend so far is one of the strongest on record. in the us we have had reports from about 60% of the s&p 500 and 81% have beat at the earnings line, coming in 6.7% above consensus. this compares to the historical beat of 73% of companies and a median beat of 3.4%. this is made even more impressive by the fact that consensus estimates were not downgraded in the month leading up to earnings season compared to a typical 1% downgrade according to db’s binky chadha. he notes also that the results so far point to 15% eps growth in q1 which is the fastest pace since 2011. our european equity strategists note also that eps growth of stoxx 600 companies has accelerated to 23% with reported earnings being 13% above pre-season expectations. switching our focus now to the main weekend news. in terms of data, the main focus was on china where yesterday we got the official april pmis. the data came in a little bit softer compared to march. the manufacturing pmi was reported as falling 0.6pts to 51.2 (vs. 51.7 expected) and the lowest level this year, while the non-manufacturing pmi declined 1.1pts to 54.0 and the lowest since october last year. the majority of markets in asia are closed today including china so we might have to wait to see if there is much of a reaction tomorrow. of those open however both the nikkei (+0.50%) and asx (+0.29%) have edged higher on thin volumes while us equity futures are also slightly firmer. the greenback also rebounded from early losses following the spending bill headlines. in terms of other news to report from the weekend, in italy former pm renzi was re-elected as the head of the ruling democratic party after securing more than 70% of votes. his reappointment was largely as expected however the margin of victory will likely be seen as giving renzi a strong mandate ahead of a general election early next year. meanwhile the latest brexit development concerns the release of the european council guidelines which are intended to govern the eu’s brexit negotiations with the uk (you can find them here https://goo.gl/ nw8nbo) which were unanimously backed following a gathering in brussels on saturday. eu president donald tusk said following the meeting that “we now have unanimous support from all the 27 member states and the eu institutions, giving us a strong political mandate for these negotiations”. ec president juncker added that “the negotiations will be difficult and it will be even difficult to retain the unity that we were able to have today”. a quick wrap-up now of how markets closed out last week. following a strong run for most of the week, risk assets seemed to run out of steam a bit on friday. despite some decent earnings in the tech sector from amazon and alphabet the s&p 500 (-0.19%), dow (-0.19%), stoxx 600 (-0.18%) and dax (-0.05%) all finished with what were fairly modest losses still as markets digested a huge amount of economic data released on both sides on the pond. much of the focus was on the q1 gdp report in the us which revealed growth of just +0.7% qoq (vs. +1.0% expected). a negative contribution from inventories was cited as significantly weighing on growth along with a decline in government consumption. private consumption eked out a small +0.3% saar gain. our us economists estimate also that one reason for the weakness is residual seasonality with government statisticians not properly adjusting the data for normal seasonal variation. they estimate this to be worth 110bps on q1 real gdp. rates markets were seemingly more distracted by the eci print however which came in at a higher than expected +0.8% qoq (vs. +0.6% expected) and the largest quarterly increase since q4 2007. 10y treasury yields touched a high of 2.334% intraday following that before settling down to finish just over 1bp lower on the day at 2.281%. away from that, in the us we also got the april chicago pmi which was up 0.6pts to 58.3 in the month (vs. 56.2 expected). the final university of michigan consumer sentiment reading for april was revised down 1pt to 97.0. measures of inflation expectations were left unchanged however. closer to home in europe the main focus was on the april cpi report for the euro area. headline cpi rebounded four-tenths to +1.9% yoy last month (vs. +1.8% expected) while the core rebounded five-tenths to +1.2% yoy (vs. +1.0% expected) which is the highest since june 2013. given the timing of easter – with services inflation accounting for the big jump – we will need to see another month of data to assess how much of the move has been sustained in reality. away from that, q1 gdp in the uk came in at +0.3% qoq which was also the same for growth in france. both were a tenth below expectations. over to this week’s calendar now. as highlighted earlier, with it being a public holiday in the uk, germany and france amongst other countries today, the main focus will be on the us session where there are a number of important releases include the pce core and deflator readings and personal income and spending reports for march, as well as the ism manufacturing reading for april and construction spending in march. tuesday kicks off in asia with the japan services and composite april pmis and caixin manufacturing pmi in china. over in europe all eyes will be on the final april manufacturing pmis as well as a first look at the data for the periphery and uk. the euro area unemployment rate will also be released. in the us tomorrow the only data due out is vehicle sales in april. kicking things off on wednesday will be germany where the april unemployment numbers are due to be released. shortly after that we’ll get euro area ppi for march and then the advanced q1 gdp report for the euro area. in the us on wednesday we’ll get the adp employment change report in april and the final april pmis and ism non-manufacturing reading. in the evening on wednesday all eyes then turn over to the fed meeting. in asia on thursday the early data is out of china with the remaining april caixin pmis. in europe we’ll also get the remaining april services and composite pmis as well as euro area retail sales in march and uk money and credit aggregates data. in the us on thursday the data includes initial jobless claims, q1 nonfarm productivity and unit labour costs, march trade balance, march factory orders and the final revisions to march durable and capital goods orders. with little of note in europe on friday the main focus will be on the us where we’ll get the april employment report including nonfarm payrolls. away from the data, this week’s fedspeak is reserved for friday when we’ll hear separately from fischer, williams and yellen, as well as a panel debate with rosengren, evans and bullard. over at the ecb this week we are due to hear from nouy and nowotny on tuesday and lautenschlaeger, praet, draghi and mersch on thursday. at the boj we are due to hear from kuroda on tuesday, as well as receiving the minutes from the boj meeting last month. other important events this week include a fox interview with us treasury secretary steven mnuchin today, a meeting between germany’s merkel and russia’s putin on tuesday, wednesday’s live televised debate between french presidential candidates macron and le pen, wednesday’s meeting between president trump and palestinian authority president abbas and uk local elections on thursday. finally, expect earnings to also be a big focus for markets this week with 131 s&p 500 companies reporting and 85 stoxx 600 companies reporting. amongst those reporting are apple, bp, bnp paribas, facebook, merck, tesla, time warner, pfizer, hsbc, bmw, shell and vw. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints:

3244,"Goldman: ""We Have Become Less Confident About Near-Term Hikes""",2017-04-20 14:16:00+00:00,"while various fed presidents continue to  toe the party line, saying they expect 3 rate hikes in 2017, most recently the fed's kaplan earlier this morning, the firm which not only sets fed policy but now openly tells the president what to do, goldman sachs, is starting to get cold feet, and in a note released overnight, the firm's chief economist jan hatzius says that ""we have become a bit less confident about near-term hikes."" the u-turn was to be expected as it comes just days after goldman threw in the towel on its long-dated strong dollar call, which traditionally comes hand in hand with revisions to fed rate guidance. that said, despite the hinted caution of a possible upcoming cut to its rate hike forecast, hatzius still maintains his existing call for two more hikes in 2017 and says that while ""market pricing of future fed rate hikes has declined in the wake of weaker gdp and inflation data, signals of an earlier fed balance sheet runoff, and reduced optimism on fiscal easing"" he notes that ""markets may be underestimating three factors pointing toward continued steady hikes. first, despite a higher funds rate, our fci has eased in recent months as global growth now looks more resilient than earlier in the cycle. second, not only the growth-positive aspects of the trump agenda but also the growth-negative aspects—especially the specter of protectionism—have receded in recent months. third, labor market slack has now largely evaporated even when we measure it very broadly."" that said, his point about financial conditions continuing to ease is notable. as hatzius points out, ""the sensitivity of financial conditions to a higher funds rate is far lower than at the time of the december 2015 hike, probably partly because the global economy looks much healthier than a year ago. the fed hiked both in december 2016 and march 2017, yet financial conditions are at their easiest levels since august , as shown in exhibit 1. this has pushed the fci impulse from deeply negative in 2015 and early 2016 to significantly positive now. our analysis suggests that the swing in the fci impulse is a much more important driver of us growth than fiscal policy, at least for 2017."" in other words, goldman may well be right that the fed will hike at least two more times if yellen's ultimate intention is not so much to slowdown the economy, which is already doing that on its own, but to prick the financial bubble yet do so in a way that does not force a crash in stocks. what this means is that if the market wants to avoid a ""forced hike"", the s&p will have to drop substantially lower from current levels to remove the ""overly easy conditions"" overhang. here is hatzius' full update on what he now expects from the fed: * * * today we discuss our outlook for fed policy in q&a format: q: what is your forecast for fed policy in 2017-2018? a: we expect hikes at the june and september fomc meetings, an announcement of balance sheet runoff in december, and a return to quarterly rate hikes in march 2018. q: how has your confidence around this forecast changed in recent weeks? a: we have become a bit less confident about near-term hikes, for two reasons. first, the 0.12% drop in march core cpi was a sizable disappointment . about half of the downside surprise was due to the combination of a one-off change in quality-adjusted telecommunications prices related to the adoption of unlimited data packages by verizon and a methodological change in how the bureau of labor statistics accounts for such changes. but even the more persistent cpi components—shelter and medical care—fell short, and we shaved our forecast for core pce inflation in q4 to 1.9%. second, economic growth looks a bit softer than a few weeks ago. while we would attribute much of the weakness in q1 gdp tracking—our estimate is 1.3% and many others are lower—to seasonal adjustment difficulties, our current activity indicator (cai) is also coming back down to earth. the preliminary reading for april is 2.9%, still strong in absolute terms but clearly a less buoyant message than in the first quarter when the cai averaged 3.6%. these developments have led us to shave our subjective probability of a hike at the june fomc meeting to 60%, from 70% previously . they have also introduced a bit more risk around our modal forecast of a september hike. q: others seem to have moved their view much more. the market-implied probability of a hike in june stands at only about 40%, little more than one hike is priced for the remainder of 2017, and only somewhat more than two hikes are priced cumulatively through the end of 2018. why? a: our interpretation is that two policy-related worries have exacerbated the impact of the weaker data on bond market sentiment. the first is that an earlier start to balance sheet runoff—relative to expectations at the start of the year—could result in a lengthy pause in the normalization process for the funds rate. the second is that the growth-positive aspects of the trump agenda have stalled. in particular, the failure of aca repeal/replace has also hit expectations of fiscal easing, which featured prominently in many market participants’ expectations for stronger growth. we take a somewhat more sanguine view. on balance sheet runoff, we expect only a limited impact on bond yields and financial conditions, equivalent to only about 5bp in terms of the funds rate. our view is consistent with the very benign market reaction to the recent fomc discussion about earlier balance sheet runoff. on tax cuts, we think the read-across from the failure of health care reform is limited. it is politically much easier to deliver a net benefit to the electorate via tax cuts than to take away health care coverage. thus, we still see a tax cut of around 1% of gdp as likely. q: but would you agree that the news—even if not decisive—has been incrementally negative for the prospects of further rate hikes pretty much across the board? a: not really. in fact, there are three areas where developments have been more positive than we would have expected at the beginning of the year. first, the sensitivity of financial conditions to a higher funds rate is far lower than at the time of the december 2015 hike, probably partly because the global economy looks much healthier than a year ago. the fed hiked both in december 2016 and march 2017, yet financial conditions are at their easiest levels since august, as shown in exhibit 1. this has pushed the fci impulse from deeply negative in 2015 and early 2016 to significantly positive now. our analysis suggests that the swing in the fci impulse is a much more important driver of us growth than fiscal policy, at least for 2017. exhibit 1: fci has eased despite fed hikes source: goldman sachs global investment research second, while the growth-positive aspects of the trump agenda have hit rougher air, the growth-negative aspects also look less concerning. in particular, the specter of protectionism—a major source of concern during the transition especially for trade with china and mexico—has clearly receded in recent months. third, the us economy has made substantial further headway in reducing labor market slack in recent months. this is not only true for the unemployment rate, which is now 0.2pp below the fomc’s estimate of its structural level, but also for broader measures of slack. to illustrate this, exhibit 2 plots the unemployment rate u3, the underemployment rate u6, and a demographically adjusted version of the employment/population ratio which holds the age/gender composition of the population constant at its december 2007 level and thereby removes the impact of the aging of the population. we standardize the data by subtracting the level of each variable in the fourth quarter of 2005, when the economy was generally seen to be at full employment, dividing by the standard deviation of each series, and inverting the u3 and u6 series for comparability. the chart shows that even the broad measures now show the labor market at or very close to full employment. exhibit 2: labor market at full employment source: department of labor, goldman sachs global investment research q: if the economy is at full employment, why has wage growth picked up so little? the employment cost index is up just 2.2% year-on-year. a: that’s true, but the overall eci can be noisy because of its inclusion of incentive-paid occupations, where pay is lumpy, and because of the ups and downs of benefit costs. exhibit 3 shows that our wage tracker—a weighted average of the eci for wages and salaries excluding incentive-paid occupations, average hourly earnings, compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, and the atlanta fed’s wage growth tracker calculated from the household survey—has risen to 2.9%. this is still a few tenths short of our 3¼% estimate of its full-employment level, which we calculate as the fed’s 2% inflation target plus our 1¼% assumption for trend whole-economy productivity growth. but part of the gap probably reflects the recent, apparently cyclical, weakness in productivity as well as the lagged weakness in headline inflation. if we focus on unit labor costs as an alternative indicator of (productivity-adjusted) wage pressures, this has been running at or above the fed’s 2% inflation target for a couple of years now. exhibit 3: a gradual but persistent acceleration in wage growth source: department of labor, federal reserve bank of atlanta, goldman sachs global investment research q: what is the risk to the economy if the fomc does less than you forecast? do you worry about a big inflation overshoot? a: not much. partly because inflation expectations seem so well anchored, we think the probability of a big inflation overshoot is limited. moreover, we agree with the notion that a move in core pce inflation to modestly above 2% over the next few years can be justified in the context of a fully symmetric inflation target and an economy subject to infrequent but large negative shocks. so what is the problem? essentially, that continued above-trend growth could push the labor market decisively beyond full employment before too long. this would raise the risk of recession down the road because unemployment significantly below its structural level is not sustainable indefinitely—eventually, inflation probably would pick up more substantially, even if it takes a long time, or other economic imbalances would develop. but history says that pushing up the unemployment rate gradually is difficult. after all, there has never been a rise of more than 0.3-0.4pp that was not associated with a recession. while that is a historical regularity rather than an economic law of nature, we think the fomc should not and will not want to take the chance of a big employment overshoot. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",goldman sachs China Goldman Sachs Bureau of Labor Statistics Federal Reserve Jan Hatzius Market Sentiment Bond Global Economy CPI Recession Unemployment Verizon Core CPI Federal Reserve Bank,1
3297,"Fed's Rosengren: ""Quite Likely"" The Fed's Balance Sheet Will Be Used In The Next Recession",2017-04-19 18:17:00+00:00,"the fed has not even announced the framework of what its balance sheet ""normalization"" would look like, and already boston fed president rosengren is talking about the next fed qe program. in a speech titled “the federal reserve balance sheet and monetary policy” delivered to bard college on wednesday afternoon, rosengren said that structural changes in the macroeconomy "" may necessitate more frequent use of large-scale asset purchases during recessions "" and he said it is "" quite likely"" that the use of central bank balance sheets will be necessary in future economic downturns. the reason?  a combination of low inflation, low rates of productivity growth, and slow population growth may imply an economy "" where equilibrium short-term interest rates remain relatively low "" by historical standards. in other words, the natural rate, or r-star, is so low, the fed will only be able to hike rates a handful of times before it tip the economy over into contraction, requiring a new easing regime. as a result, reductions in short-term rates to combat recessions will encounter the zero boundary and ""will not be sufficient,"" rosengren said – so ""it is likely to be more common for central banks to engage in asset purchases to stimulate the economy by reducing longer-term rates. "" ""so balance-sheet expansions – and exits – are likely to become more standard monetary policy tools around the world. "" as a quick reminder, for all the talk of tightening, central banks are currently creating just under $200 billion in new money every month... ... and the total size of the big 6 central banks is now over $18 trillion. still, to avoid spooking the market too much - after all the fed's balance sheet should shrink before it expands again - rosengren noted that the federal reserve should adopt balance sheet exit strategies ""that reinforce the primacy of interest rate policy."" the boston fed president said that while the fomc is still carefully considering its balance sheet exit strategy, his ideal policy ""would take a very gradual approach to balance sheet reduction."" ""in my view that process could begin relatively soon, and should not significantly alter the fomc's continuing gradual normalization of short-term interest rates,"" he said. rosengren added that by initially retiring only a small percentage of maturing securities, and then very gradually shrinking the volume of the securities being reinvested, ""the tightening of short-term interest rates should not need to be much different than it would be in the absence of shrinking the balance sheet."" ""starting to shrink the balance sheet earlier – and doing so in a very gradual fashion – implies very little reduction in the degree of monetary stimulus coming from the u.s. central bank's balance sheet,"" rosengren said. ""this, in turn, will allow policymakers to focus on gradual increases in the federal funds rate target as the primary mechanism for normalizing monetary policy and calibrating the economy."" but while fed presidents warning about balance sheet reduction has been the norm in recent months, rosengren's unexpected suggestion that a new qe is only a matter of time appears to have spooked stocks, which moments after he spoke, slumped to new intraday lows despite what was an otherwise cheerful speech. full speech can be found here. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Central Banks Recession,1
3320,"European Stocks, Futures Rebound As Stronger Dollar Eases Haven Demand",2017-04-19 11:39:00+00:00,"european stocks rebounded after the biggest one-day drop since november, alongside s&p futures, while asian equities posted modest declines after yesterday's weak us close. gold and yen slid, while the dollar gained on the latest mnuchin comments to the ft according to which trump was ""absolutely not"" trying to talk down the dollar. european equities rose 0.4% in early trading, hinting at some cautious optimism following a day of risk off sentiment, and reversing the 0.6% fall in asian equities outside japan which dipped to a one-month low.  u.k. shares initially traded lower as the pound held much of its gains following the surprise election announcement, however have since rebounded back to unchanged. having dragged it lower on tuesday after another major rout in china, commodity companies helped prop the stoxx europe 600 index, which rebounded following the biggest one-day loss since november. sterling pulled back slightly after reaching the strongest level since october on tuesday. oil fluctuated after dipping on yesterday's api data which showed u.s. oil inventories fell 840,000 barrels last week, a lower than expected draw. on wednesday official eia data is expected to show a larger drop of 1.4 million barrels. ""sterling rallied across the board yesterday on the back of prime minister may’s announcement of snap uk elections. the market interpreted the move as an effort to strengthen the prime minister's majority and reinforce a more unified stance for the upcoming negotiations with the eu,"" unicredit analysts said in a note on wednesday.

populism in the europe, while geopolitical tensions are simmering over both north korea and syria and the pace of monetary tightening in the world’s biggest economy looks uncertain. meanwhile, the reflation trade has soured, with june rate hike odds dropping below 50% for the first time in two months. asian shares failed to benefit from the eventual rebound in risk sentiment, and the shanghai composite index fell 0.8%, taking its four-day loss to 3.2%. the main shenzhen market was also down a fourth day. the hang seng index slid 0.4 percent and the hang seng china enterprises index dropped below the 10,000 level for the first time in two months. japan’s topix index was little changed, while australia’s s&p/asx 200 index lost 0.6 percent and south korea’s kospi index fell 0.5 percent. risk was firmer in europe,  where the stoxx europe 600 increased 0.3% as of 10:10 a.m. in london, after dropping 1.1% on tuesday. in the us, s&p futures rose 0.3% offsetting yesterday's 0.3% drop in the cash market. ibm slumped in after-hours u.s. trading after its 20th consecutive quarterly sales decline. sterling was just off a six-month peak against the dollar above $1.28 having surged when british prime minister theresa may called an early general election for june 8, seeking to strengthen her party's majority ahead of brexit negotiations. the dollar was undermined in part by an eroding interest rate advantage as u.s. bond yields dived to five-month lows. yields on 10-year treasury paper sank to 2.17%, far away from the 2.629% peak seen in march. they were last up slightly on the day at 2.20%. a run of disappointing u.s. economic data and doubts that the trump administration will progress with tax cuts have quelled expectations of faster inflation and boosted fixed-income debt. that, in turn, has taken the steam out of wall street. the dow fell 0.55 percent on tuesday, while the s&p 500 lost 0.29 percent and the nasdaq 0.12 percent. goldman sachs lost 4.7 percent in the

market snapshot top overnight news from bloomberg asian equity markets traded negative following a weaker lead from wall street, where disappointing earnings from the likes of ibm, johnson & johnson and goldman sachs dampened sentiment. this resulted in early pressure in nikkei 225 (unch.) and asx 200 (-0.5%) with weakness in financials and commodities leading the declines in the latter. shanghai comp (-0.8%) and hang seng (-0.4%) also conformed to the downbeat tone observed across their global counterparts amid mild increases in chinese money market rates, with the pboc's liquidity operations failing to provide an uplift. 10yr jgbs traded higher as participants sought after safer assets due to the dampened tone in the region, while the 10yr yield declined to 0% which was its lowest since november. pboc injected cny 40bin 7-day reverse repos, cny 20bin in 14-day reverse repos and cny 20bin in 28-day reverse repos. top asian news european markets have rebounded among an air of caution this morning with the eurostoxx trading higher by a modest 0.3% as participants continue to digest yesterday's news that pm may is to call a snap election for june 8th. before that though, focus remains firmly on the 1st round of the tense french election, in which some polls indicate that macron still holds a slight advantage over his nearest rivals (le pen, fillon). in stock specific news, earning updates have been coming in thick and fast with ab foods supported by strong results this morning, while burberry notably underperforms after the retailer stated that revenue fell short of analyst expectations. in credit markets, prices had been subdued for much of the morning with bunds relatively flat, however recent comments from ecb's hansson who noted that it is not too early to discuss ecb policy (change) has pressured the german benchmark in recent trade. top european news in  currencies, the yen dropped 0.4 percent to 108.86 per dollar after gaining 0.5 percent tuesday. the bloomberg dollar spot index rose 0.2 percent following a two-day decline. the pound dropped less than 0.1 percent to $1.2836 after its 2.2 percent surge tuesday. the euro also slipped less than 0.2 percent.  cable has given back some of its gains against the greenback after having met resistance at 1.2920 to move within proximity to the 1.2800 level with markets now awaiting the parliamentary confirmation for the go-ahead from yesterday's announcement. elsewhere, usd/jpy has continued to climb throughout the european session as geopolitical fears continue to abate, at least for the time being with the pair approaching 109.00 to the upside. elsewhere, commodity currencies have been a touch softer this morning with usd/cad tripping above 1.34, while there has been no respite for the aud as we are back testing 0.7500 against the usd, but the flow looks to be going through aud/nzd, which is now just below the 1.0700 mark. finally, eur has lost some modest ground to the broadly firmer usd with this morning's inflation data from the eurozone coming broadly in line with expectations. in commodities, gold declined 0.5 percent to $1,282.84 an ounce after closing at the highest since november in the previous session. west texas intermediate crude oil was little changed at $52.43 a barrel, after two days of losses. trade across the commodities complex remained uneventful with wti crude futures only slightly pressured following a smaller than expected headline crude drawdown in the latest api inventory report. eu trade has seen some rhetoric from opec sec-gen barkindo who said that march compliance data is showing higher conformity with supply cut pact but this has failed to provide too much traction for energy prices ahead of the us crossover. elsewhere, gold (-0.2%) continued to pull back from 5-month highs as the usd attempted to nurse yesterday's weakness, while copper found some reprieve and rebounded from 3-months lows. looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe the only data due is the final cpi report for the euro area where headline cpi is expected to come in at +0.8% mom and +1.5% yoy, and the core at +0.7% yoy. there is no data due in the us although we will get the fed’s beige book while the fed’s rosengren is also due to speak. the ecb’s coeure also speaks this afternoon in ny. earnings wise, today we will get 16 s&p 500 companies including morgan stanley and ebay. us event calendar * * * db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap we were actually watching the news on tv last night after the surprise snap uk election decision. on this the biggest call out of db over the last 24 hours was to reverse the 2 year bearish house view on sterling immediately after the announcement yesterday. our fx strategists argued last year that an early general election was the only way to resolve the political impasse the u.k. government faces in conducting brexit negotiations. the 2020 general election was a problem domestically (small dwindling majority likely forcing policy gridlock and compromises) and externally in as far as negotiating with europe from a weak position in 2019 as the brexit deadline approached. the election on june 8th will likely result in a larger conservative majority (see latest polls below). this should have three material implications, in their opinion. first, it makes the deadline to deliver a ""clean""  brexit without a lengthy transitional arrangement by 2019 far less pressing given that no general election will be due the year after. second, it will dilute the influence of mps pushing for hard brexit, strengthening the government's domestic political position and allowing earlier compromise over key eu demands for a transitional arrangement. third, it strengthens the pm's overall negotiating stance who  in recent weeks has clearly fallen in line with the european negotiating approach. this will involve a settlement of the brexit payments and other divorce aspects first, to be followed by a lengthy transitional period during which the final outcome of brexit will emerge. this sequenced approach materially reduces the ""crash risk"" of brexit negotiations as well as strengthening the prime minister's hand in pursuing an orderly (and very lengthy) withdrawal. all of the above in turn reduce downside risks for the u.k. growth outlook over brexit negotiations. our fx team will look to publish fresh targets in the coming days. in terms of the economic impact, db’s mark wall believes that a larger government majority should also reduce brexit-related downside risks. however, he hesitates from assuming much upside yet for economic growth or for boe policy rates. mark believes that the conservatives are likely to campaign on an uncompromising “hard brexit” message and the capacity to concede in negotiations in the eu will come later. he holds his 1.8% gdp growth forecast for 2017 and sees little upside relative to his 1.1% gdp forecast for 2018. a link to both reports can be found here. just on those polls, a snap online icm poll released yesterday in the hours following the election announcement showed that, with a polling sample of 1000 people, support for the conservatives stands at 46%, with labour at 25% and the lib dems at 11%. the 3 polls prior to this (icm, yougov, comres) showed the conservatives as holding an average 20% lead over labour, so not too dissimilar. the ft poll tracker also shows the conservatives as holding 43% of the support compared to 25% for labour (or an 18% lead). the ft also references electoral calculus which predicts a conservative majority of 130 seats in the 650-seat house of commons. that compares with a working majority of just 17 seats currently. unsurprisingly the news of the snap election was initially most felt in fx with sterling rallying immediately and closing 3 big figures higher or +2.20% at $1.284 – the highest level since october 3rd. that was the biggest rally for the pound versus the dollar since january 17th when pm may delivered what was largely considered a fairly balanced brexit speech. that move in sterling yesterday weighed heavily on uk equities with the ftse 100 (-2.46%) ironically suffering its biggest one-day loss since the post-brexit aftermath on june 27th. the index is also now back to within just 0.7% of the february lows. the big dollar earning blue-chips suffered most of all with some of the biggest losers including bhp (-5.59%), glencore (-5.58%), bp (-3.93%), glaxosmithkline (-3.67%) and antofagasta (-3.41%). in contrast the more domestically orientated ftse 250 closed down just -1.16%. for me i have to weigh up whether the potential cheaper cost of my next iphone purchase (never too far away) offsets my declining domestic share portfolio. it's a close one!!! there wasn’t much better news for risk assets outside of the uk yesterday either. in europe the stoxx 600 closed down -1.11% while last night the s&p 500 bounced back to pare its loss to a more modest -0.29%. one sector which notably underperformed was us financials (-0.83%) which came after goldman sachs disappointed analysts with a miss at both the revenue and earnings lines following its q1 report yesterday. in contrast to what we’ve seen with other us banks this reporting season - including bofa yesterday - the miss was largely as a result of disappointing performance in the ficc business. the other  story in markets yesterday was the move in rates. in keeping with the largely risk-off tone but perhaps also reflecting the lingering geopolitical concerns and also the upcoming french presidential election this weekend to some degree, 10y bund yields initially rallied 3.1bps to 0.153% for the lowest closing yield this year before 10y treasuries then rallied 8.2bps to 2.169% for the lowest close since november. this morning in asia the majority of bourses are following the lead from wall street and europe yesterday and are currently tracking lower. the hang seng (-0.74%), shanghai comp (-1.10%), kospi (-0.50%) and asx (-0.56%) are all in the red. it’s worth noting that materials names are underperforming, which isn’t a surprise given the moves for metals over the last 24 hours. most notable is the latest leg lower for iron ore which fell another -4.60% yesterday and is now down over -33% from the february highs. elsewhere, the nikkei is currently little changed, helped by a slightly weaker yen. us equity index futures are a touch higher however despite ibm reporting softer than expected sales figures after closing bell last night which saw shares tumble 5% in extended trading. meanwhile in bond markets this morning the most notable move is that for jgb’s where the 10y (using the march-2027 maturity bond) has fallen below 0% (touching -0.005%) for the first time since mid-november. it’s worth adding that the boj today maintained the amount of 5y and 10y bond purchases in its regular bond buying exercise. yesterday we saw the latest cspp numbers and it’s looking like i might have to say 'i was wrong' soon which are words a research analyst always struggles with. i thought that the ecb might taper corporate purchases alongside government bonds but the early evidence suggests some evidence otherwise. however the 'strong' numbers of the last two weeks (post taper) might be slightly distorted by two pretty weak weekly numbers in march and the easter break but the average daily purchases in the 4 business days last week of €423mn were comfortably above the daily average of €368mn since the program started. but if you average it over 5 days it goes down to €338mn/day. so until we see the full month's purchases on may 2nd (two weeks time) we really can't be sure. at that point the ecb will surely want to have signalled how they have split the taper. to be fair my colleague michal has been more of the opinion that they'll keep cspp 'stronger for longer' than me. it's important as for the last few months i've felt that although technicals have been strong for credit, the technicals for bunds have been even stronger (see a recent credit bites for more https://goo.gl/xmy0dq ) thus creating headwinds for spreads. if the cspp is staying 'stronger for longer' it will help redress that balance a little but it's too early for this to be confirmed. away from that, yesterday’s macro data was largely a sideshow. in the us industrial production was confirmed as increasing +0.5% mom as expected with capacity utilization also edging up four-tenths to 76.1%. manufacturing production did however decline -0.4% mom, led by the auto sector. elsewhere, housing starts were confirmed as declining a relatively steep -6.8% mom (vs. -3.0% expected) although that was somewhat offset by a two percentage point upward revision to the february print to +5.0%. building permits was reported as rising +3.6% mom (vs. +2.0% expected). away from this, there was no  data of note in europe however we did get other economic news out of the imf with the latest quarterly forecasts released. the fund revised its global growth forecast up one-tenth to 3.5% this year and left its 2018 forecast for 3.6% unchanged. the forecast for the us was also left unchanged at 2.3% and 2.5% for this year and next. there was also a little bit of fedspeak yesterday from kansas city fed president esther george, although again it didn’t do much to move the dial. george said that “balance sheet adjustments will need to be gradual and smooth” and that “importantly, once the process begins, it should continue without reconsideration at each subsequent fomc meeting”. looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe the only data due is the final cpi report for the euro area where headline cpi is expected to come in at +0.8% mom and +1.5% yoy, and the core at +0.7% yoy. there is no data due in the us although we will get the fed’s beige book while the fed’s rosengren is also due to speak. the ecb’s coeure also speaks this afternoon in ny. earnings wise, today we will get 16 s&p 500 companies including morgan stanley and ebay. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com

3563,Earnings Season Shenanigans - Is It Other Than Madness?,2017-04-13 21:20:00+00:00,"authored by jeffrey snider via alhambra investment partners, as earnings season begins for q1 2017 reports, there isn’t much change in analysts’ estimates for s&p 500 companies for that quarter. the latest figures from s&p shows expected earnings (as reported) of $26.70 in q1, as compared to $26.87 two weeks ago. that is down only $1 from october, which is actually pretty steady particularly when compared to q4 2016 estimates that over the same time plummeted from $29.04 to $24.16. at $26.70, that would represent about 23% growth over q1 2016. if history holds, of course, actual eps will be substantially less than that . it has become standard ritual to watch each quarter unfold in considerable disappointment. given that history, it was unusual to find that in just the two weeks since the march 23 estimates were published (to the latest of april 6) analysts have become suddenly more optimistic for later this year and especially 2018. rarely do earnings estimates that far out get much if any boost, particularly because they start out so highly positive to begin with. the expectation for q4 2017, for example, was on february 21 $32.12; cut down to $31.41 as of march 23. the latest for april 6, however, is suddenly $32.43; above even the figure from late february. for q4 2018, estimates were $34.68 in february, $33.46 at the end of march, but now $35.70. though i can’t know for sure what analysts are thinking, it seems reasonable to assume that their forecasts were changed by the fomc “rate hike” in march . it appears as if they are translating what for the mainstream is more “hawkishness” by the textbook definition of it, meaning the fed attempting to get ahead of an improving, perhaps rapidly, economy. it is a wonder to behold because it shows the utter incapacity for learning, let alone scientific principles. the models are the models no matter how much empirical refutation they have been subjected to time and again. it’s even worse in this case because of very recent history. earnings departed from the qe3 path almost three years ago, and only to keep deviating from it all the while since. admittedly, this recent upward adjustment isn’t a large one, but the very fact that it is upward makes it stand out in astonishment. in other words, the same reasons analysts may have used to perform these more optimistic calculations are the same reasons economists can’t figure out the bond market. it is why the current recycling depression economy is by far the worst case. as i wrote a few months back : the big problem with these cyclical upturns (depression cycle, not business cycle) is these positive interpretations. it will likely end up being hugely counterproductive (if it continues for long enough) in the same way as 2013-14 was attributed to qe3 and the belief that recovery was at that time not just possible but even likely (it’s amazing in review how in late 2014 the federal reserve was more concerned about “overheating” and how that view pervaded, uncritically, the whole mainstream description of what was going on). with that conventional perspective, there was and will likely be far less urgency to do what is necessary, even to (honestly) examine what it is that might be causing this sustained misery because there are seemingly plausible conditions (positive numbers) that suggest an end to the misery finally at hand. the economy ends up like a dog chasing its tail. and analysts end up forecasting growth that “unexpectedly” disappears into the ether of textbook economics, we end up wasting that much more time, and round and round we go, nary a prayer for escaping this madness. that is what this truly is, because how can it be by any rational standards of empiricism and actual observation anything else? tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Federal Reserve Bond recovery,1
3566,Janet Yellen Is The Second Worst Dove In History,2017-04-13 20:21:00+00:00,"authored by kevin muir via the macro tourist blog, the market was sent for a spin yesterday afternoon after president trump told the wall street journal the u.s. dollar “is getting too strong” and he would prefer the federal reserve keep interest rates low. from the wsj: mr. trump also said his administration won’t label china a currency manipulator in a report due this week. he left open the possibility of renominating federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen once her tenure is up next year, a shift from his position during the campaign that he would “most likely” not appoint her to another term. “i do like a low-interest rate policy, i must be honest with you,” mr. trump said at the white house, when asked about ms. yellen. “i think our dollar is getting too strong, and partially that’s my fault because people have confidence in me. but that’s hurting—that will hurt ultimately,” he added. “look, there’s some very good things about a strong dollar, but usually speaking the best thing about it is that it sounds good.” he continued, “it’s very, very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency.” mr. trump said the reason he has changed his mind on one of his signature campaign promises is that china hasn’t been manipulating its currency for months and because taking the step now could jeopardize his talks with beijing on confronting the threat of north korea. “they’re not currency manipulators,” mr. trump said. ms. yellen was a frequent target of mr. trump’s during the campaign, when he criticized her for keeping interest rates low. asked if ms. yellen was “toast” when her term ends in 2018, mr. trump said, “no, not toast.” the most amusing part of yesterday’s market move is that anyone was surprised by trump’s comments. the united states has a president that made his fortune on the back of debt, yet somehow the market thinks trump will govern in a tea-party-hard-money fashion. nothing could be further from the truth. he says yellen is “not toast.” well, i disagree. the chances of yellen being reappointed are slim, but not for the reasons many are forecasting. during the election campaign trump made some comments about low interest rates hurting the american economy. since then, market participants have mistakenly being fooled into believing trump is some sort of hard-money advocate. cough, cough… bullshit. and in case you believe trump should be taken at his word, look at all the election promises he has already gone back on. in fact, look at what he said about china just a week ago: and then compare it to what he said yesteday: patrick watson summed up the situation perfection with this tweet: we would all be wise to forget anything (and everything) trump has said, and instead just ask ourselves what his most likely course of action will be once he gets to that fork in the road. and there is little doubt in my mind that given the choice between cutting spending, raising taxes, instituting tighter monetary policy, and the alternative of just inflating away, he will choose the easy money option. i don’t think yellen stands a chance of being reappointed, not because trump wants to put jim grant in charge of the federal reserve, but because he will be looking for a modern day rudolf havenstein . the truth of the matter is that yellen has done nothing but tighten during her whole tenure as fed chairperson. yellen is the second worst dove in history. she has presided over a collapsing yield curve and soaring us dollar. how does that jive with trump’s recent comments? yesterday the market was hit over the head with the idea of “easy money” trump. yet here is the twist they haven’t figured out. not only will trump replace yellen next year (she will be blamed for the coming slow down/recession), but the fomc board has an unusual amount of upcoming reappointments. 7 out of 11 of the 2018 fomc voting board members will be potentially appointed by trump! meanwhile speculators are massively betting on higher short term us dollar rates. the market has badly misinterpreted trump’s monetary leanings, but so far not panicked because they believe janet & co. have their back. well, next year’s fomc board will look dramatically different. betting on their continued hawkish tendency is crazy. one of these days the market will panic, and the rip roaring short cover at the front end of the yield curve will be vicious. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China White House North Korea Federal Reserve Yield Curve Janet Yellen Jim Grant Monetary Policy Wall Street Journal Recession,1
3581,The Illusion Of Liquidity,2017-04-13 15:18:00+00:00,"authored by lance roberts via realinvestmentadvice.com, i thought the following quote from janet yellen’s q&a at the university of michigan this week was interesting regarding the lessons i thought were learned from the financial crisis. “first, we supervise banking organizations and some other financial enterprises to make sure that they operate in a safe and sound fashion. second, we monitor potential threats to financial stability. we certainly don’t want to have another financial crisis and we want to redress threats in the environment that could lead to one. we had a system in which banking organizations were not monitoring and controlling risk appropriately. they had too much capital and were overleveraged.” silly me. while talk is cheap, the reality is the federal reserve fostered another surge in leverage by promoting and maintaining “accommodative” policies for far too long. the chart below is the aggregate of corporate, consumer, margin and banking debt in billions. i have excluded governmental debt so we can focus on the leverage in the economy. i have added gdp for comparative purposes. it is worth noting that from 1959 to 1983, it required roughly $1 of debt to create $1 of economic activity. however, as i have discussed previously , the deregulation of the financial sector, combined with falling interest rates, led to a debt explosion. as shown below this debt explosion, which allowed for an excessive standard of living, has led to the long-term deterioration in economic growth rates. if we add governmental debt, student loan debt, and entitlements into the equation, the problem gets far worse. however, the point i want to address here is the level of debt in the system which has once again reached new records since the financial crisis. what could possibly go wrong this time? there is an inherent belief that corporate and bank balance sheets are in much better shape today than they were in 2007. while i will not argue that banks are indeed on better footing, the repeal of fasb rule 157 allowed banks to “mark assets to fantasy,” which vastly improved their balance sheet health. the question that should be asked of ms. yellen is simply: “after trillions in various bailouts of the financial system, and claims the ‘health’ of the financial system is good, why does fasb rule 157 still remain repealed?” the answer is simple.  the “health” of the financial system may not be as strong as advertised. but i digress. as debt levels increase, the servicing of that debt diverts capital from productive investment. furthermore, the use of debt as it relates to “current” consumption, which is 70% of economic growth, is “future” consumption denied. in other words, individuals use debt to pull “forward” consumption which leaves a “void” in the future. however, since “debt accumulation” is “finite,” there is a point to where excess debt is resolved through default, write off, or bankruptcy as witnessed during the “financial crisis.” it is this accumulation of debt which has provided a dangerous illusion of liquidity. but it may be showing signs of coming to an end. the chart below shows bank loans and leases as well as bank reserves held at the fed. the precipitous drop is somewhat concerning. commercial bank reserves held at the fed have dropped by -20% from the peak of $2.79 trillion in 2014 to $2.23 trillion currently. also, as shown, the drops in reserve balances has also corresponded to declines in 10-year rates as well. the recent drop in rates from 2.6% a month ago to 2.3% on tuesday will likely see reserve balances decline in the next data update. furthermore, the year over year change in commercial bank loans and leases has dropped by almost half from the narrow range of 7.6% to 8.0% that prevailed from jan. 2015 to sept. 2016 to the current level of 3.8% currently which is at the level that preceded the past two recessions.  also, the annual change in commercial bank deposits held at the fed has dropped by more than one-half from the recent high of 10.3% in 2012 to 4.8% currently. as my “canadian economist” (i know, two strikes already) friend, gerry o’brien, pointed out: “the deteriorating trends in commercial banking activity is important, especially when combined with the fed’s indication from their recent fomc minutes they are considering plans to begin reducing their balance sheet this year. their ongoing march to hike rates, and now potentially reduce liquidity, suggests a rapid reduction in liquidity which will hit stocks and interest rates this year.” don’t dismiss the importance of that statement. when looking at the fed balance sheet from a long-term view it only appears to have flattened compared to the massive increases that were taking place previously. of course, given the recent spike in the market since the election, many have assumed the liquidity push by the fed has been replaced by stronger earnings and economic growth expectations. not so fast. if we zoom in we can see the reinvestment process taking place by the fed which continues to provide support for assets prices though continued injections of liquidity into the system, albeit at a much lower pace. to be clear, i am not suggesting this is the only catalyst to the rise in the market since the election. clearly, the return of “exuberance” due to the “expectations” of tax cuts, repatriation, and infrastructure have led to a surge in optimism along with numerous other factors like an extremely warm winter and a restocking cycle driven by a coming increase in logistic rates. however, “expectations” have gone unfulfilled and the restocking cycle to beat a price hike has likely come to an end. this puts the fed in a precarious position of tightening monetary policy without a fiscal policy offset. of course, it is not just the fed slowing the rate of liquidity but also the central banks of england and china. with the bank of japan and the european central bank recently hinting at they may also begin to “taper” their respective liquidity driven operations, all of this suggests the illusion of liquidity may be starting to evaporate. the illusion of liquidity has a dangerous side effect. the process of the previous two debt-deleveraging cycles led to rather sharp market reversions as margin calls, and the subsequent unwinding of margin debt fueled a liquidation cycle in financial assets. the resultant loss of the “wealth effect” weighed on consumption pushing the economy into recession which then impacted corporate and household debt leading to defaults, write-offs, and bankruptcies. with the push lower in interest rates, the assumed “riskiness” of piling on leverage was removed. however, while the cost of sustaining higher debt levels is lower, the consequences of excess leverage in the system remains the same. outside of other events such as the s&l crisis, asian contagion, long-term capital management, etc. which all drove money out of stocks and into bonds pushing rates lower, recessionary environments are especially prone at suppressing rates further . given the current low level of interest rates, the next recessionary bout in the economy will very likely see rates approaching zero. furthermore, given rates are already near zero in many parts of the world, which will likely go negative during a global recessionary environment, near zero yields will still remain more attractive to foreign investors. this will be from both a potential capital appreciation perspective (expectations of negative rates in the u.s.) and the perceived safety and liquidity of the u.s. treasury market. lastly, my recent points on current levels of volatility, and the expectation of a reversal, also support the idea of lower interest rates. as i stated: “in my opinion, there seems to be a higher than normal probability that volatility will take a turn higher sooner rather than later. as such as i have added a net long position in portfolio betting on a rise to hedge against the coincident decline in my net long equity holdings at the current time.” not surprisingly, increasing rates of volatility that coincide with declines in asset prices have also coincided with declines in interest rates. the chart below shows the historical correlation between bonds and stocks. since the turn of the century, the “risk on/off” trade can be clearly seen. however, beginning with qe3 in 2013, that historical correlation was broken but now looks like to be returning back to historical norms. with volatility low and the stock/bond ratio at historically high levels, the reversion of those two indicators has historically led to substantially lower yields. here is the point, while the punditry continues to push a narrative that “stocks are the only game in town,” this will likely turn out to be poor advice. but such is the nature of a media driven analysis with a lack of historical experience or perspective. from many perspectives, the real risk of the heavy equity exposure in portfolios is outweighed by the potential for further reward. the realization of “risk,” when it occurs, will lead to a rapid unwinding of the markets pushing volatility higher and bond yields lower. this is why i continue to acquire bonds on rallies in the markets, which suppresses bond prices, to increase portfolio income and hedge against a future market dislocation. in other words, i get paid to hedge risk, lower portfolio volatility and protect capital. bonds aren’t dead, in fact, they are likely going to be your best investment in the not too distant future. in the short-term, the market could surely rise. this is a point i will not argue as investors are historically prone to chase returns until the very end. but over the intermediate to longer-term time frame, the consequences are entirely negative. as my mom used to say: “it’s all fun and games until someone gets their eye put out.” tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ]

3586,"Gross: ""All Asset Prices Are Elevated To Artificial Levels""",2017-04-13 14:05:00+00:00,"bill gross' latest monthly outlook is divided into two sections: in the first, the world's former bond king provides a revealing glimpse into his mind courtesy of six brainteasers (with answers to questions such as ""if forced to choose between killing your favorite pet or an anonymous human being, what would you do?""); in the second he goes back to his favorite topic: slamming the trump growth narrative can the trump agenda recreate 3% growth? the answer: he cites an imf study which suggests that ""unless there is an unforeseen technological breakthrough, productivity growth is unlikely to return to the higher rates of the 1990's for advanced economics or the early 2000's for emerging economics. in other words, their warning speaks to a global productivity slowdown, not just a u.s. based phenomena. they warn that increasing tariffs and developing restrictions on immigration will only exacerbate the slowdown. global growth, and of course u.s. growth, will be lower than average, they forecast."" which then leads to the following, not unexpected conclusion about assets prices: equity markets are priced for too much hope, high yield bond markets for too much growth, and all asset prices elevated to artificial levels that only a model driven, historically biased investor would believe could lead to returns resembling the past six years, or the decades predating lehman . high rates of growth, and the productivity that drives it, are likely distant memories from a bygone era. then again we assume that gross' note was written before yesterday's stunning "" trump flip."" what we are far more curious about, is whether now that the president is on board with his goldman advisory committee, and is pushing for a weaker dollar and lower rates (i.e., an end to fed tightening and more qeasing), and thus, more doves on the fomc, whether gross will likewise flip his opinion of trump in the next monthly letter. for now, however, here is the latest one, via janus . * * * brainteasers a recent internet blog posed the predicament of many medium/long-term relationships: at some point couples run out of historical stories or even topical things to say. after all, there are only so many trump tweets you can talk about, and you've long since agreed to disagree about the meaning of life. the blog suggested inventing some new philosophical brainteasers to keep the conversation alive. having written investment outlooks for over 30 years now, i thought it apropos to follow the same approach, so here are my twisters and summary comments following each. spoiler alert: please think of your answer before reading the ""comments"". 1) if forced to choose between killing your favorite pet or an anonymous human being, what would you do? comment: in a usa today survey from a decade ago, the majority of responses seemed to favor killing the person and saving the pet! 2) would you rather be ""interested"" or ""interesting""? comment: most say ""interested"", (as would i), but it's a close vote. 3) if you were offered one year of quality life in addition to how long you would have lived anyway, would you give up your cellphone for it? comment: this one creates the most controversy. young people do not give up their phones. older people jump at the chance for that additional year. they don't know how to use a cellphone anyway! 4) if you were stranded on an island with a totally repugnant looking and abusive human being, would you entertain romance with him (her)? personal comment: maybe at 22, not 72! 5) if offered the certainty of a second life after your current one, but it would be a life of misery with no moments of happiness, would you take it? comment: a few actually say yes, suggesting that their misery might in some way lead to happiness for others. 6) is there an emotional distinction between saying ""luv you"" and ""i love you""? comment: almost certainly. inserting the ""i"" signifies a much stronger – and riskier – personal commitment. * * * investment brainteaser: can the trump agenda recreate 3% growth? well, now, that is the investment question of the hour/day/decade and its conclusion, unlike romance on a desert island, will determine the level of asset prices across the investment spectrum. 3% growth leads to a levered rate of corporate revenue/profit increases and a significantly higher p/e ratio, all else equal. 3% growth also sends a green light/all clear signal to high yield bonds and other risk assets that are leveraged and growth dependent. it may also, although not necessarily, lead to higher real interest rates and a future bond bear market. so what's the answer? well, growth is productivity dependent, and the experts are in a tizzy trying to explain why productivity in the last five years has averaged only .5% versus a prior pre-lehman ""old normal"" of 2%+. fed chair janet yellen, speaking on april 10th, said that no one really knows the answer, which was her way of saying that the past five years' experience has been three standard deviations outside of the fed's model. but others, such as northwestern university economist robert gordon, have long argued that lower productivity may now be a function of having picked all of the ""low hanging fruit"" such as electrification and other gains from 20th century technology. then there is the obvious connection between recent years' low levels of private sector investment, which perhaps begs another as to why that is so low. optimists claim that the future benefit of smartphones and medical technology have yet to have an impact and that eventually – much like the introduction of the automobile – they will lead to a resumption of historical trends. but in a detailed report by the imf, their economists argue that the current trend is an offspring of the financial crisis. slowing business investment/trade and an ongoing level of low to negative interest rates have resulted in a misallocation of capital to low risk projects and a slowdown in small business creation. longer term secular demographic factors such as an aging population also play a significant part since older consumers consume less of almost everything except health care. so chair yellen may just be sticking to her old models and her educated but ""common sense"" deficient staff that claims that no one really knows the answer. she may need to ""tease"" her brain that is so focused on historical but dated economic models. there may be answers and solutions that other organizations are coming to grips with. the same imf study suggests that unless there is an unforeseen technological breakthrough, productivity growth is unlikely to return to the higher rates of the 1990's for advanced economics or the early 2000's for emerging economics. in other words, their warning speaks to a global productivity slowdown, not just a u.s. based phenomena. they warn that increasing tariffs and developing restrictions on immigration will only exacerbate the slowdown. global growth, and of course u.s. growth, will be lower than average, they forecast. and if so, what are the investment conclusions? well here's where a two handed economist might fall back on the conclusion of my six original brainteasers: there is no right or wrong answer. but since i have two hands but have frequently been accused (praised) of not being an economist, i'll post my own comment. equity markets are priced for too much hope, high yield bond markets for too much growth, and all asset prices elevated to artificial levels that only a model driven, historically biased investor would believe could lead to returns resembling the past six years, or the decades predating lehman. high rates of growth, and the productivity that drives it, are likely distant memories from a bygone era. if you're ""interested"" in investment performance, hopefully you'll find these conclusions somewhat ""interesting"". now pick up your cellphone and know that the only real way to have one more year of extended life is to feast on blueberries instead of oreo cookies and to exercise daily instead of heading for your couch and widescreen. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Janet Yellen Bear Market Equity Markets High Yield Bond Lehman Real Interest Rates,1
3662,"""The Fed Is Once Again Making A Policy Error""",2017-04-12 13:07:00+00:00,"authored by kevin muir via the macro tourist blog, remember a few years back, in the midst of the u.s. qe programs, all the negative talk about how “the fed would never be able to taper their bond buying?” when yellen & co. successfully navigated that hurdle, the doomsayers moved over to, “raising rates will be a disaster for the u.s. economy.” well, a year and a half later (and after two hikes), the world has not ended. faced with these two defeats, the chicken little crowd has adopted a new motto. “the federal reserve will never be able to reduce their balance sheet,” has now become the war cry for those of bearish persuasion. at times during yellen’s tenure, i have become concerned when the federal reserve tightened too quickly. when the fed’s rhetoric pushed the u.s. dollar higher at a destabilizing rate, or when the tighter american policy caused oil to crash, i warned the federal reserve did not seem to realize their policies’ effect on the rest of the global financial system. i know the u.s. dollar is the world’s reserve currency, and yet the federal reserve tunes monetary policy for american economic conditions, but there can be no denying the fed’s relatively hawkish path (especially when compared to other central banks), has caused a great degree of stress throughout the world. but here we are; two hikes under the fed’s belt, the front end of the yield curve pricing in another two for the remainder of the year, and fomc members introducing plans for a balance sheet wind down. who’d thunk the s&p 500 would be within spitting distance of all time highs after all of that? if i didn’t know better, i would say the federal reserve is accomplishing their goal of withdrawing accommodation without having the whole financial system come crashing down. in a creeping fashion, the fed is doing what the naysayers said couldn’t be done. i must admit, i am a little surprised it has gone so smoothly. but i wonder if the federal reserve isn’t pushing their luck. last fomc meeting minneapolis fed president neel kashkari dissented against the rate hike in part because he felt the federal reserve should concentrate on winding down their balance sheet. given that during the 2008 credit crisis the fed argued bond purchases during quantitative easing was accommodative, it follows that unwinding their balance sheet would be restrictive. instead of raising rates, neel felt the fed should substitute rate hikes with portfolio unwind. makes sense, and in the week after the meeting, many fed officials came right out and acknowledged this was a path they were preparing for. then last week, the third most important person at the fed (right behind yellen and fischer), ny fed president bill dudley said the following: “it wouldn’t surprise me if sometime later this year or sometime in 2018, should the economy perform in line with our expectations, that we’ll start to gradually let securities mature rather than reinvesting them.” “if we start to normalize the balance sheet, that’s a substitute for short-term rate hikes because it would also work in the direction of tightening financial conditions.” “if and when we decide to begin to normalize the balance sheet we might actually decide at the same time to take a little pause in terms of raising short-term interest rates.” i (and many others) wrote a piece about how the fed was shifting from rate hikes to balance sheet wind down. i argued the fed would most likely raise two more times (since that was pretty much all baked in) and then proceed to focus on withdrawing accommodation by letting their balance sheet run off. this sort of prudence seemed logical. after all, there has never been a successful winding down of a balance sheet by a central bank. we are in uncharted territory. gently taking their foot off the brake during this dangerous period makes complete sense for the federal reserve. no one knows how markets and the economy will react. better to err on the side of doing no harm, than instead slamming the economy with too much braking. dudley’s remarks made perfect sense to me, and obviously to the rest of the market as the yield curve steepened and priced in this new reality. yet for some reason, dudley did not like the way they were interpreted. in an absolute harebrained move, on friday dudley redirected the market. from bloomberg: dudley said his march 31 comments that caused bonds to rally and steepened the curve were “misconstrued” by some. a pause “at the time you make the decision on the balance sheet” would be to make sure it “doesn’t turn out to be a bigger decision than you thought you were making. so, i would emphasize the words ‘little pause,”’ dudley said talk about sending the market scurrying back. suddenly the market was no longer just worrying about fed rate hikes, but the added burden of rate hikes along with balance sheet wind down loom large. so far it seems as if financial markets are taking it in stride, but i wonder how long before the u.s. economy reels from the pressure. right now we are in an environment where all news, is good news. i understand that the markets make the news, but i was perplexed by friday’s reaction to the employment report. even in the face of a terrible number, market participants found ways to spin it bullishly. but famed ex-merrill lynch strategist david rosenberg’s interpretation seems more credible. from business insider: the warmest february on record boosted construction jobs two months ago, but hiring cooled again in march, reducing overall employment by 10,000, according to rosenberg. winter storm stella, which blasted through the northeast in mid-march, also shaved up to 20,000 jobs off the headline on friday. “so strip out all the weather impacts, and the payroll figure still would have ended up being well short of the consensus at a mere +128,000,” rosenberg said. economists had forecast 180,000 nonfarm payrolls. “then tack on the downward revisions of 38,000 to the first two months of the year, and the bottom line is that there is no possible way to put lipstick on this pig of a report,” rosenberg said. “full stop.” rosenberg also noted that some of the weaker sectors were those that catered to final consumer demand. retail lost 29,700 jobs in march after a loss of 34,700 in february. hiring has declined amid a wave of store closures — about 3,500 stores are expected to close over the next few months. “it may well be that retailing accounts for barely more than 10% of the total employment pie, but keep in mind that it is a sector that caters to 70% of the overall economy known as the american consumer,” rosenberg said. heck, even the fed’s own gdp modeling tool “gdp now” has been trending lower over the past month. it is now predicting a mere 0.6% growth rate for the 1st quarter. and it’s easy to see why. loan growth is rolling over. i found this great chart on twitter from hansmrkts : that’s what raising rates will do. the fed’s policies are having their effect, but the members of the fomc are ignoring the data staring them in their face about the actual economy. instead, they are fretting over the price of stocks and other financial instruments. yeah, i get it. they let a bubble brew out of control last time, so now they are determined to not let it happen again. so much so, that when dudley insinuates that the fed will take a pause in hiking to allow the balance sheet to run down, and instead of the stock market selling off on that news, it rallies, dudley rushes out to take back the portion of the plan that involves reducing the tightening. do you really think that if spooz gave up 50 handles on that announcement, dudley would have bothered to “clarify” his comments about a “little” pause on friday? not a f’ng chance. over the past few years, many market participants have complained that the federal reserve changed policy too quickly based on the stock market reaction. i would agree that they seem way too focused on that one aspect of the economy. but if they were too quick to ease on an s&p dip, it’s not unrealistic to expect them to be too quick to tighten on an s&p rip. it’s a ridiculous policy, yet why should we expect anything different from these knobs? we are in the process of the stock market diverging from the economy. given the fed’s over eagerness to set monetary policy based on the s&p 500 level, they are pushing too hard on the brake right now. the fed is once again making a policy error. they are tightening too hard, taking every little bit the market will give them. this occurred in march when they realized they could speed up the tightening pace without upsetting markets. and now it is happening again with dudley backtracking because he understood the markets could withstand tighter policy. yet, even though financial markets are rocketing higher, this fed tightening will hurt the real economy. and it’s only a matter of time before the two converge. just remember, eventually the alligator got chubbs… you can’t outrun your destiny. tips: tips [

3691,Monumental Gridlock Meets Blind Euphoria,2017-04-11 23:01:00+00:00,"authored by patrick watson via mauldineconomics.com, wishful thinking, as we all know, is the death knell for many investors. getting carried away by emotion has rarely, if ever, been a recipe for accumulating vast riches. it seems that a lot of people have missed that distinction between wishful thinking and reality lately—and i fear it’s going to hurt them badly. after donald trump won in november, some americans didn’t just hope for the best; they thought it was here. the euphoria is visible in the small business optimism index , which is published by the national federation of independent business. confidence spiked higher following the election because surely, people thought, an all-republican white house and congress would waste no time ushering in business-friendly policy changes. while that was a reasonable conclusion, now it looks like small-business owners may have let their political excitement affect their common sense. the jury isn’t in yet on how massive the changes are going to be. and the nfib index hasn’t pulled back much, so respondents seem to be patient so far. you could say the same for investors. stock benchmarks rose after the election, particularly in regulated sectors like banking and energy, because investors believed policy changes would lead to higher earnings. i was less confident, and said so in my december yield shark letter. can trump and the republican-controlled congress do anything to justify this kind of shift? i don’t think so. yes, we’ll get some tax cuts and deregulation. they might trim government spending here and there. but they can’t possibly do as much as some people expect for 2017. the senate will spend weeks, possibly months confirming trump’s cabinet appointees and a supreme court justice. the house will have to come up with the “replace” side of its “repeal and replace obamacare” pledge. add in democratic delay tactics and heavy lobbying from opposing interest groups, as well as resistant state and local officials and court challenges, and i see little chance that trump will deliver all or even most of his agenda as fast as people expect. so, i think stock bulls should curb their enthusiasm—otherwise, they will get a rude awakening at some point next year. i’m still convinced that’s true—and the “rude awakening” may be even closer now. in that same issue, i showed yield shark subscribers the following decision tree from one of louis gave’s epic gavekal research presentations. it’s four months old now, but still a good analytical guide: answering two questions leads you to one of four scenarios, each with a different investment strategy. let’s think about these in order. if the us economy is a coiled spring ready to surge, it has a strange way of showing it. even the most optimistic projections show real gdp growth for 2017 will be little better than last year’s disappointing 1.6%. i think our economy is the opposite of a coiled spring. it’s been stretched past its limits by debt. aside from insane federal, state and local government debt, we owe trillions more in credit card, auto, student loan, and mortgage loans. that stands in the way of any meaningful expansion. but let’s suppose for the sake of argument the economy really wants to grow, and all it needs is a little nudge from the government. are those policy changes right around the corner? i don’t think so. the trump administration’s first 100 days are running out, and we have yet to see any major legislation pass. the obamacare repeal/replace plan is still on the table but not doing well. the gop is divided at least three ways. compromises that would bring more conservatives aboard repel the moderates—and vice versa. furthermore, the healthcare reform bill wasn’t just healthcare. it would have eliminated the obamacare taxes on higher-income americans… and its medicaid cuts were going to offset lower corporate tax rates in other legislation. now that’s much harder. scratch healthcare and tax reform off the list. bank deregulation? that’s going nowhere. we hear talk about amending the dodd-frank act, but nothing concrete is happening. worse, the trump administration still hasn’t gained control of key regulatory agencies. as of now, the securities and exchange commission (sec) only has two commissioners. one is a democrat. the commodity futures trading commission (cftc) is similarly split. new chairs for both agencies are pending in the senate. but even after they’re confirmed, the democratic commissioners can stop any reforms cold simply by boycotting the meetings, thereby preventing a quorum. that would be easy to fix, though: the president could simply nominate more commissioners and then outvote the democrats. i don’t know why he hasn’t. maybe he has other priorities. maybe no one wants those jobs (i sure wouldn’t). the federal reserve board has no nominees for its three open slots either. banks can’t count on much administrative relief until the president gets his people in control of the regulatory agencies—and that’s nowhere on the radar right now. infrastructure stimulus? it’s bogged down in a debate how to pay for it. last week, trump told the new york times he would consider borrowing “much more” than $300 billion for infrastructure projects. you can imagine how gop deficit hawks loved that idea. it won’t mesh well with their desire to cut tax rates without adding more debt. trump has talked about making deals with democrats if he can’t get enough republican votes to pass his bills. but democrats have little reason to cooperate. their base voters are energized against trump and won’t stand for it. bottom line: instead of a unified republican government, we have near-total gridlock. i think the answer to our first question, “does the us economy have pent-up growth potential that a trump presidency can unlock?” is clearly “no.” scratch louis gave’s scenarios 1 and 2 off the list. as for the fed… the policy-setting federal open market committee (fomc) spent last year building up its nerve for more rate hikes. it gave us one in december and another in march, and more are coming. the fed is clearly on a tightening path, but is it “aggressively” so? that’s not as clear. we saw in the march dot plots that even the most hawkish fomc member thinks the longer-term federal funds rate will only rise to 3.75%. other estimates came in at 3% or lower. that’s “tight” only compared to years of near-zero rates. of course, 3% rates might feel tight to a generation of millennial traders who have never seen anything like it before. but that’s not all. the march fomc minutes, released last week, showed the fed is seriously considering how it will unload its bloated bond portfolio. they could start letting assets roll off without replacement later this year, which could have more impact than rate hikes. looking back at the decision tree, i think the no/yes path is the most likely. the economy isn’t ready to surge, but the fed will tighten policy anyway. not a good combination, but i’m in the minority. most investors still have their bets on yes/yes. some are starting to get nervous. given events in washington, they should be. i am sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but here’s reality as i see it. it doesn’t matter if we’d like this to happen. it is what’s coming, in my opinion. i haven’t even mentioned other flash points: a potential government shutdown after april 28, more military action overseas, or trade conflicts with china and other countries. i also haven’t mentioned the assorted russia-related investigations. whatever happened in the election, the fallout is distracting both the white house and congress. i’ve thought about what could possibly change all this for the better. nothing comes to mind. recent reports suggest trump wants to shake up his white house team. that may help, but he’s already lost of lot of time and political capital. to me, this situation feels like a slow-motion train wreck where all you can do is watch. much depends on the 1q earnings reports that start flowing this week. good results from high-profile companies might buy a little more time. unexpectedly bad results from big names could put on the brakes. washington’s monumental gridlock is on a collision course with investors’ blind euphoria. we’re all on one train or the other. hold on tight. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China White House New York Times Donald Trump March FOMC Commodity Futures Trading Commission Federal Reserve Rude Awakening Securities and Exchange Commission Monetary Policy Bond Obamacare Mortgage Loans NFIB Reality,1
3777,Goldman Downgrades French Bonds Ahead Of Elections,2017-04-10 14:10:00+00:00,"roughly at the same time as today's french election narrative shifted again as traders started paying attention to the suddenly surging in the polls far-left candidate jean-luc melenchon, which pushed the euro to the lowest level in a month, goldman has come out with a recommendation to short june oat futures (oatm7) at 147-72, for an initial target of 144.00, and stops on a close above 150.00, in the note, goldman's francesco garzarelli writes that a victory by a moderate reformist presidential candidate (fillon, macron), which is the base case at the bank, would result in a narrowing of french bond spreads but may be offset by a selloff in core rates. he writes that the “fair level” of 10-year spread to bunds is in the region of 30bp-40bp, from 70bp currently, according to goldman the bank adds that it expects french bond spreads and yields to come under upward pressure if the first round of election were to result in a strong showing of anti-establishment candidates (le pen, melenchon), while by contrast, u.s. treasuries may instead rally on the event, on the back of flight-to-quality flows. full excerpt below: duration looks expensive: open tactical shorts in french oat us 10-year treasury yields have fallen around 30bp since reaching a local peak of around 2.6% before the fomc meeting on 15 march. more than two thirds of the decline in us bond yields over this period reflects lower real rates, with 'break-even' inflation more or less stable. as yields have fallen, investors appear to have pared back their short positions. according to cftc data up to 04 april, net speculative short positions in 10-year treasuries futures have gone back to levels last seen before the election of president trump. our empirical analysis on cross-country spill-overs indicates that the rally in major bond yields over the past three weeks - including us treasuries -has been driven primarily by the fall in german yields to fresh lows. in bigger-picture terms, our models suggest that us treasuries are still trying to lift global rates up, while jgbs and more recently gilts have been pulling them in the other direction. german yields are the ‘tie-breaker’ in these dynamics. our sudoku framework, which relates 10-year government bond yields to evolving consensus expectations on future growth, inflation and monetary policies, suggests that us treasuries remain relatively better aligned to their macro underpinning than their counterparts in europe and japan. that said, the valuation gap between treasuries and the other g-4 bond markets (calculated from 2000 onwards) has declined from the 90-th percentile in early march down to the low 80s . even us treasuries are now approaching levels that qualify as moderately ‘expensive’ in absolute terms the combination of cleaner positioning and absolute and relative valuations offers a better entry point for shorting duration. after recommending a tactically neutral stance in q1 (our end-march forecast for treasuries was 2.5%), we expect the second quarter to mark a transition to higher yields and continue to forecast that treasury yields end the summer at 2.75-3.00%. reflecting on the residual valuation gap between the us and europe, however, and consistent with our idea that the global bond premium is being eroded largely by the actions of the ecb and the boj, we are of the view that, for a move upwards in treasury yields to be sustained, core european markets need to participate. we recommend going tactically short june french futures (oatm7) at 147-72, for an initial target of 144.00, and stops on a close above 150.00. this position allows one to take a directional view on duration in a market that scores as very expensive on our valuation metrics. in relation to the risk to this trade emanating from the political sphere, a victory by a moderate reformist candidate (e.g., fillon, macron) - which is our european economics team base case - would result in a narrowing of french bond spreads (the 'fair level' to bunds is in the region of 30-40bp, from 70bp currently) but offset by a sell-off in core rates. we would expect french bond spreads (and yields) to come under upward pressure if the first round of the presidential election were to result in a strong showing of anti-establishment parties (e.g., le pen, melenchon). by contrast, us treasuries may instead rally on the event, on the back of flight-to-quality flows. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Gilts Japan Bond,1
3827,"Citi: Central Banks ""Took Over"" Markets In 2009; In December The ""Unwind"" Begins",2017-04-08 22:29:00+00:00,"citigroup's crack trio of credit analysts, matt king, stephen antczak, and hans lorenzen, best known for their relentless, austrian , at times ""zero hedge-esque "" attacks on the fed, and persistent accusations central banks distort markets, all summarized best in the following citi chart ... ... have come out of hibernation, to dicuss what comes next for various asset classes in the context of the upcoming paradigm shift in central bank posture. in a note released by the group's credit team on march 27, lorenzen writes that credit's "" infatuation with equities is coming to an end ."" what do credit traders look at when they mark their books? well, these days it is fair to say that they have more than one eye on the equity market. understandable: after all, as the fomc minutes revealed last week , even the fed now openly admits its policy is directly in response to stock prices. as the credit economist points out, ""statistically, over the last couple of years both markets have been influencing (“granger causing”) each other. but considering the relative size, depth and liquidity of (not to mention the resources dedicated to) the equity market, we’d argue that more often than not, the asset class taking the passenger seat is credit. yet the relationship was not always so cosy.  over the long run, the correlation in recent years is actually unusual. in the two decades before the great financial crisis, three-month correlations between us credit returns and the s&p 500 returns tended to oscillate sharply and only barely managed to stay positive over the long run (figure 3)."" what is the reason for this dramatic pick up in cross-correlations? a familiar one, of course (see the top chart): ""much of the correlation not just between these two, but also with many other asset classes seems closely associated with the ongoing central bank balance sheet expansion."" however, now that global central banks are entering the tightening phase, and as the balance sheet slows, ""or even begins to reverse over the coming quarters, we expect the negative impact on credit will be more than proportionate. "" lorenzen also warns that while things might not quite revert to the historical norm, to our minds, there are at least three reasons to suspect that the relationship between debt and equity won’t stay this cozy for much longer: to be sure, it's not just central bank manipulation of markets: one key factor mentioned by the citi credit strategists is the maturity of the cycle which will increasingly put capital structure into play. one reason for that is that ""credit and equities are impacted equally by the changing mix of fundamental drivers during the cycle. both credit and equities very obviously benefit from the natural improvement in earnings that tends to occur early on in an economic expansion. however, as the expansion matures, growth in operating earnings tends to fade (figure 6), companies wishing to maintain the momentum in their share prices increasingly resort to releveraging, be it through investment, m&a or share buybacks to make up for fading organic growth. however, this capital structure arbitrage obviously has a very different (i.e. negative) impact on credit. well, maybe in theory, but in practice spreads and yields remain stubbornly tight, and thus beckong corporate management to keep engaging in financial engineer. citi admits as much in saying that ""in that sense, this cycle has perhaps been atypical, in that us corporates have resorted to share buybacks much earlier in the expansion than normal. this was in part a response to the glaring gap between the cost of equity and the cost of debt, but also a defensive reaction to a lack of investment opportunities in a recovery characterised by weak demand and a lack of pricing power . credit is more susceptible to an end to unconventional policies. "" however, that does not mean that eqities are impervious to cycle shifts. if anything, the belated response in risk assets will simply mae the eventual drop that much more acute, as increasingly more have been observing the ""feedback loop"" between equity prices and selling vol (see friday's wsj piece on the topic). which, incidentally. brings us to the topical conclusion: as we discussed when commenting on the ""feedback loop"" piece, it is all made possible by central banks pressing down on vol and being the ""buyer of last resort"" whenever a market correction takes place. citi admits as much and reverts to the original topic of the conundrum of ""why the strong correlation between and debt and equity markets still holds. to our minds, the obvious explanation is central banks. wi thout turning this into yet another essay on qe and negative rates, we think their policies have overridden normal market behaviour in response to the evolving cycle . citi then shows how a wide spectrum of asset classes has been exceptionally correlated since the end of the gfc when viewed on a normalised basis. "" the common factor in all of these (approximated by a simple average) in turn correlates remarkably well with the rate of expansion in central bank holdings of securities (figure 8). "" and while lorenzen writes that he does not want to turn his latest report into "" another essey on qe"", he does just that: this suggests there may be distortions in all. but to our minds credit is clearly more distorted than most others, like equities, are – especially in europe. policies intended to flatten the curve and bring long-dated real interest rates down have left total return buyers with precious little return potential from taking rates risk. taking credit risk instead has been an obvious choice, encouraging inflows and, in turn, spread tightening. the punchline: "" it’s no accident that this rise in return correlations between equity and credit (figure 3) occurred almost exactly at the time when the central banks effectively ‘took over’ markets ."" while that worked as long as central banks were bidding everything up starting in 2009 (again, see top chart)  now that said period is ending, the ""unwind is underway"": however, with the fed now tightening faster than the market anticipated not long ago, and our economists expecting that it will cease to reinvest maturing securities in its portfolio from december this year, the unwind is underway . to us, this adds to the asymmetry in risk/reward between credit and equities here. even so, lorenzen says not to panic just yet: perhaps the very short-term correlations between equity levels and credit spreads can be sustained. we’d argue that the credit trader should spend as much time, if not more, looking at bunds as eurostoxx these days . but that does not preclude a high degree of correlation if the equity trader does the same.... however, what cannot be sustained indefinitely, in our view, is the correlation in medium-term returns for all the reasons we outlined above. in other words, the closer we get to december, or whenever the fed begins renormalizing the balance sheet, the greater the trader angst, and impetus, to undo all the trades that worked in the time when central banks had ""taken over the markets."" tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Equity Markets Central Banks recovery Real Interest Rates,1
3839,"Morgan Stanley: ""Wage Growth Is Leveling Off, May Be Slowing""",2017-04-08 16:06:00+00:00,"while friday's headline payrolls print - the lowest since may - was disappointing even to the biggest economic optimists, many found refuge in the sharp drop in the unemployment rate, which ticked lower to 4.5%, the lowest print in a decade. and yet there was a problem: with the unemployment rate tumbling, at least in theory indicating even less slack in the labor market, wage growth barely hit consensus estimates. instead, if indeed the growth narrative is accurate, and if more people were employed, wages should be rising. however, it was this weakest link of the entire reflation/recovery narrative that disappointed once again. in fact, it was even worse: as morgan stanley's robert rosener write overnight, ""wage pressures in march were supported almost entirely by a massive jump in earnings in professional & business services. outside of this bright spot, wages in other industries were muted, and suggests wage growth in a broad range of industries may be leveling off, or even slowing. "" as rossener further notes, to describe wage pressures in march as 'spotty' may be an understatement. the 0.19%m gain in average hourly earnings was supported almost entirely by a massive jump in the professional & business services industry. outside of this one bright spot, wage pressures in other industries were surprisingly muted (exhibit 1), and suggests wage growth in a broad range of industries may be leveling off or even slowing. according to ms, the 0.92% sequential gain in average hourly earnings in professional & business services was the second largest monthly increase on record, and this accounted for nearly all of the increase in aggregate average hourly earnings. in other words , average hourly earnings would have been roughly flat on the month were it not for the outsized increase in earnings for professional & business services. to be sure, the bounce in wage growth for this job category was decidedly welcome: as a generally high-paying industry, stronger wage growth in professional & business services can go a long way in supporting stronger aggregate outcomes for average hourly earnings. the key question from here is whether or not the upside in march can be sustained, or if it's just noise. yet while the silver lining in professional services will be closely watched, a bigger question is what happens to wages in all the other key indudtries, where as noted above, march saw substantial weakness. here, rosener writes that ""consistent with signs of a recent softening in wage pressures in a number of industries, our wage growth diffusion index has shown a meaningful narrowing in the breadth of wage pressures across industries in recent months— only 38.5% of industries are now showing above-trend rates of wage growth, down from 46.2% in february and a high of 61.5% in august 2016 ."" some more observations from morgan stanley: * * * taking all that, and the bigger jobs picture in mind, what does the labor market mean for the fed's june decision? the answer: it depends on whether you see the glass as half empty or half full. the optimist says, ""well, the unemployment rate continues to fall and the fed has been expecting the pace of job gains to slow. at 163k per month over the past 6 months, shown in exhibit 2, the economy has been adding jobs well above the pace needed to keep the unemployment rate moving lower."" the labor market is tightening, right? the pessimist says, ""despite continued strength in the labor market, signs of labor market tightness are few and far between. yes, the unemployment rate is falling, but core measures of wage growth remain anemic. just look at the year-on-year rate of wage growth among production and non-supervisory workers, as shown in exhibit 3. at 2.3% y/y in march, growth in wages of these workers was lower than it was in the year ending early 2014. this just means nairu (natural rate of unemployment) is lower."" morgan stanely's summary: ""even though nairu could be (much) lower, we don't think the fomc consensus will let that affect their decision on rates for now. one weak headline payroll number is also unlikely to dissuade the consensus from believing that continued gradual rate hikes remain appropriate. however, if the april or may payroll number disappoints, that could change.... we'll be watching carefully for clues as to whether small business hiring slows in the wake of inaction by the trump administration and republican-controlled congress. so we'll be watching with interest the nfib small business optimism index released on tuesday, april 11."" what this means for markets and the economy: the trump ""reflation"" rally, having already withered across many market indicators, has finally moved to the economy and actual wages, where it increasingly appears to have been nothing more than a mirage. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Morgan Stanley Volatility Unemployment recovery NFIB,1
3856,Weekend Reading: Markets May Be Getting Expensive,2017-04-07 21:31:00+00:00,"authored by lance roberts via real investment advice, let me suggest a warning. two week’s ago , i discussed the failure of congress to get the affordable care act (aca) repealed, much less replaced. the problem, of course, i s the failure to repeal the aca leaves in question the ability to pass other agenda based items such as tax reform, border wall construction, repatriation or immigration reform. “reaching an agreement on the fy budget resolution will not be easy; in the past, conservatives have demanded a balanced budget within ten years but this would require endorsing spending cuts (in non-binding form) that some centrist republicans might oppose along with the bat. of course, while wall street believes ‘tax reform’ will be a much easier process than repealing health care, the reality is it could be just as tough as government entitlement programs, funding for planned parenthood, and other programs central to the democrats, and some left-leaning republicans, come under attack. ” this past week, while congress still hasn’t made any advance towards solving the current health care debate, paul ryan, house majority leader, confirmed my discussion on the rising risk of tax reform failure . to wit: “u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on wednesday that tax reform will take longer to accomplish than repealing and replacing obamacare would, saying congress and the white house were initially closer to agreement on healthcare legislation than on tax policy. ‘ the house has a (tax reform) plan but the senate doesn’t quite have one yet. they’re working on one. the white house hasn’t nailed it down. so even the three entities aren’t on the same page yet on tax reform.’ “ just to remind you, the entire catalyst behind the post-election rally has been the “hope” that tax cuts will boost earnings enough to support current market valuations . however, interestingly, while the markets continue to hope for “fiscal policy” reforms, according to the release of the fomc minutes there is little consideration being given to trump’s agenda. from the minutes : “participants continued to underscore the considerable uncertainty about the timing and nature of potential changes to fiscal policies as well as the size of the effects of such changes on economic activity. however, several participants now anticipated that meaningful fiscal stimulus would likely not begin until 2018. in view of the substantial uncertainty, about half of the participants did not incorporate explicit assumptions about fiscal policy in their projections.” furthermore, the fomc also raised concerns over the level of valuations in the markets. “broad us equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, and some measures of valuations, such as price-to-earnings ratios, rose further above historical norms. a standard measure of the equity risk premium edged lower, declining into the lower quartile of its historical distribution of the previous three decades. stock prices rose across most industries, and equity prices for financial firms outperformed broader indexes.“ of course, valuations have been a topic of great debate in recent months particularly as they pushed into levels only witnessed prior to the 1929 and 2000 crashes. this leaves markets with the “hope” trade in peril as congress continues to trip itself up in moving its legislative agenda forward while, at the same time, the fed has accelerated the pace of monetary tightening and sending clear warnings to the markets. this has “bad” written all over it. just some things i am thinking about this weekend as i catch up on my reading. * * * trump/fed/economy * * * markets * * * research / interesting reads “there is no training that prepares for trading the last third of a move, whether it’s the end of a bull market, or the end of a bear market.” – paul tudor jones tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",White House Fail Paul Tudor Jones Dumb Money Bear Market Tyler Durden Monetary Policy Bond Risk Premium John Hussman Obamacare Wall of Worry Mexico Reality,1
3857,"Boring Equity Action Masks ""Devastating Eurodollar Unwinds"" After Dudley Speech",2017-04-07 21:06:00+00:00,"on the surface, and in equities, it was a painfully boring day. stocks tumbled overnight after yesterday's syrian airstrikes, then as it emerged that the conflict will likely be contained, futures ground higher and not even the worst jobs report in nearly a year managed to put a damper on today's rebound, as the narrative shifted to the drop in the unemployment rate, which dropped to 4.5% on the back of a 400k+ increase in employment according to the bls' household survey. a sharp bounce in the dollar/usdjpy/treasury yield complex during bill dudley's speech around noon tried - and failed - to inspire a levitation in the s&p ... ... which ended up closing the day small in the red, despite so much earlier drama. and yet, while on the surface things appeared calm, below the surface, and especially in the eurodollar complex there was a surge in activity, courtesy of the abovementioned bill dudley remarks. what happened? recall the previously discussed eurodollar 2018 (edz7/edz8) spread, which as we showed yesterday , had finally broken below a key support level... ... and was threatening to pull the technical support for the 10y. in fact, with the 10y dropping as low as 3.28% in early trading during the overnight, risk-aversion phase, the reflation trade appeared all but dead. that's when bill dudley took the podium. this is what he said: “some people misconstrued what i said last week. i said a little pause. a pause is pretty short already, and i think a little pause is even shorter than that.  presumably at the time that you make the decision on the balance sheet you might want to forgo the decision on short-term rates just to make sure that the balance-sheet decision doesn’t turn out to be a bigger decision than you thought you were making. so, i would emphasize the words ’little pause.’ ” while those words were largely ignored by equity traders, momo chasers and various algos, they meant all the difference to eurodollar traders, and anyone who had assumed that following bill dudley's comments last week, that the fed would ""pause"" its rate hikes during the balance sheet runoff phase. we'll start with the result, and show just how big the move in the edz7/edz8 trade was: what the chart below shows is that as a result of dudley's hawkish comments, the eurodollar spread spiked to the highest level since the fomc minutes, where as a reminder the fed's balance sheet unwind was a primary topic. so what happened? as rbc's charlie mcelligott expains, dudley delivered the “clarification heard ‘round the (global macro trading) world,” as dudley, in a mid-friday afternoon interview, sought to alter the market’s initial interpretation of his massively impactful comments made last week , in turn disrupting thematic trades across the macro landscape. those comments about the likelihood of a “little pause” in the fed’s hiking trajectory as-and-when the fomc begins the process of balance-sheet normalization sent shockwaves through the front-end of the us rates complex, forcing devastating stop-outs / unwinds in mega popular macro “reflation” trades like eurodollar redpack shorts / edz7edz8 steepeners and the edz7-8-9 butterfly and a lot pain at various and unconstrained funds over the course of the past week . as mcelligott adds, the pain seemingly-culminated in this morning’s syria strike / nfp headline clunker / stockholm terror attack trifecta, which sent markets into their initial ‘risk off’ spiral, driving a major ust bid. even as stocks recovered over the course of the morning (as per my note this morning), rates remained pinning near the high-profile psychological 2.30 level nearly all day.  seemingly, the mix of new longs (after the momentum in the ‘short rates’ trade reversed 3 weeks ago) and capitulation from legacy shorts was behind the strength.  and then, dudley “dropped the bomb” in his above-quoted “clarification.” essentially, dudley said that the fed will not be substituting b/s policy tweaks for fed hikes, which as noted had quickly become the new market narrative in short-order .  he was clearly taken aback by the market reaction to his comments and viewing them as a statement on the fed looking to reduce the scale of the overall 2018 hiking landscape .  in turn, the price-action via the stop-outs and unwinds in the front-end trades over the past week were violently reversed this afternoon. indeed, as the chart below shows, the vollume in the eurodollar spread was the highest since election night! some other aftereffects: nominal yields turned sharply higher.  breakevens turned off their worst levels too.  ust curves flattened.  the us dollar screamed higher against everything from g10 to em (everybody’s recent ‘fave’ high-yielding longs as it seemed the dollar was ‘stuck’). in equities, the higher rates dynamic reinvigorate “cyclicals” and “value” factor, while “defensives” / “low volatility” / “anti-beta” factor market-neutral rolled over.  and as i’ve been pointing-out, “growth” logically settled-back too, as it had become a hyper-crowded “hiding-place” over the course of the year as investors sought stocks which could perform without fiscal policy and interest rate exposure.  thus, faang and pane (fb, aapl, amzn, nflx, googl and pcln, amzn, nflx, expe story stocks in tech / consumer discretionary) lagged broad index on the day.  thus ‘momentum’ market-neutral reversing lower on the day too. mcelligott's conclusion: as such, i’m getting sudden jolts of confidence from the last of the ‘reflation hold-out’ clients, now feeling really emboldened. and for the folks who didn’t cover their rates shorts or unwind their ed$ curve trades, there are now statues being built for dudley in various fund offices around midtown . the one risk that i see right now for ‘risk’ is this: that we are seeing the largest move tighter in ‘real rates’ since the day post-march fed hike.  this idea of “tightening faster than we are growing” / “inflating faster than we’re growing” continues to be a concern to monitor. bloomberg opined also, noting that dudley comments benefited a fresh wave of hawkish eurodollar bets. re-established downside options positioning across eurodollars unexpectedly benefited from dudley comments friday as focus shifts to clarity from yellen on monday.  signs are emerging that traders are looking to re-establish eurodollar put positions across 2018 maturities, potentially a sign that the rally in reds -- triggered by dudley’s comments a week ago -- may have been overdone. friday’s cme open interest changes rose in june 2018 eurodollar puts by 106k contracts; largest gains across 9762 (+25k), 9800 (+30k) and 9812 (+48k) strikes consistent with downside trades initiated thursday. while open interest is starting to build again across june-18 eurodollar puts, there has been a sharp drop in jun-17 open interest, reflecting position liquidation. latest cftc positioning data, covering week ending april 4, shows speculators adding $1.8m/dv01, to record eurodollar shorts. earlier this week, a purge of eurodollar positions saw heavy losses, one of which included a trade liquidated wednesday for a $15m hit, across jun/sept./dec mid-curve eurodollar spreads from march 1. the purge came as a result of a collapse in eurodollar spreads, along with the fed probability term structure which inverted as the rate-hike probability edged higher for june 2017 but then fell further out after dudley’s comments last week. if all of this sounds overly technical for regular equity traders, don't worry it is, however the implications for the yield curve, and thus the reflation trade, or what's left of it, are substantial. it also means that as we pointed out yesterday, suddenly focus has intensified on janet yellen, who’s scheduled to speak at 4pm monday at university of michigan, taking questions from the audience and twitter. what she says may roil if not the equity market, then certainly lead to a new set of big headaches for eurodollar traders. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Twitter Yield Curve Janet Yellen University Of Michigan Bill Dudley EuroDollar Momo B+ Unemployment B.S.

3874,US Stock Funds Suffer Biggest Outflow Since 2015 As Bond Inflows Soar,2017-04-07 15:56:00+00:00,"according to bank of america's michael hartnett, citing epfr data, in the latest week through april 5, there were $7.4bn in outflows from equities, the largest in 40 weeks. this consisted of $3.6bn in etf outflows - largest in 40 weeks & first outflows ytd vs. $3.8bn mutual fund outflows. by size & style: 3rd straight week of outflows from us value funds ($1.7bn), largest outflows from us growth in 10 weeks ($2.0bn); $0.9bn outflows from us small caps & chunky $10.3bn outflows from us large caps (largest in 82 weeks) by sector: inflows to tech ($0.8bn, 5 straight weeks), materials ($0.2bn), utilities ($0.3bn), real estate ($0.2bn), infrastructure ($0.1bn); outflows from energy ($0.6bn, largest in 29 weeks), financials ($0.3bn), consumer ($0.2bn), healthcare ($0.1bn) at the same time, bonds recorded $12.4 bn of inflows, the highest in 8 weeks, with treasuries posting largest inflows in 10 weeks as the ""great reflationary rotation"" crumbled once again. curiously, this took place prior to the fomc minutes warning that stock prices are ""too high."" by geography, the focus was entirely on the u.s., where stocks saw the largest outflow since 2015, or in 82 weeks, as $14.5 billion was redeemed . this was offset by europe which had its second straight week of inflows ($900m); japan drew $300mm while $2.4bn entered emerging markets. an amusing chart shows that while tech funds attracted $800m of inflows, thee has been a surge of inflows into ""robot funds."" a separate analysis from lipper showed largely the same, as investors yanked the most money from u.s.-based equity funds since december during the latest week, on fears stocks may be overpriced given the many roadblocks in implementing u.s. president donald trump's economic policies, according to reuters. lipper adds that nearly $12 billion drained from the stock funds in the seven days through april 5, including $7 billion spdr s&p 500 etf, a fund actively traded by investors ranging from institutional investors making speculative bets to retail buyers. retail investors pulled back for another week, as stock mutual funds continued a streak of net outflows that has lasted the better part of the last two years. the outflow totaled $7.4 billion during the week. meanwhile, u.s.-based funds invested in stocks abroad took in $1.1 billion during the week. ""there's a whole lot of uncertainty right now, which is never good for the equity markets,"" said pat keon, senior research analyst for thomson reuters lipper. keon said the united states' response to conflict in syria and north korea has intensified jitters over policy even though market returns have been strong. matthew bartolini, head of spdr americas research at state street global advisors, said outflows likely include both long-term investors who are trimming their winning bets and shorter-term investors shifting to other markets, something suggested by jeff gundlach in his latest webcast. investors' worries also included march u.s. auto sales data, which this week came in far below expectations. finally, while active investors continue to suffer, passive vehicles such as etfs are unable to hold the inflows: as bloomberg's eric balchunas calculates , in the first quarter vanguard alone took in $121 billion, amounting to an unprecedented $2bn per day, and was 46% better than any other q1, should the inflows into etfs continue, vanguard is on pace to rake in a record $480bn for the year. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Gundlach Japan North Korea State Street Auto Sales Reuters Institutional Investors Equity Markets Bond Jeff Gundlach Real estate,1
3883,RBC Explains Today's Rush To BTFD,2017-04-07 13:04:00+00:00,"after plunging 150 points on syria airstrike headlines overnight, dow futures have retraced much of the losses this morning as any shift in the investing landscape towards 'risk-off' appears to have been dismissed as the buy-the-f**king-tomahawk-missile-launch-dip'ers are back in force betting on the success of the administration's tax reform, or stimulus, or earnings, or hope. however, gold prices remain elevated leaving some trace of doubt about president trump's actions. however, rbc's head of cross asset strategy, charlie mcelligott, points out that the missile strikes change none of the calculus for him ... the same way that terror attacks are tragic and scary and initially ‘spook’ people, historically they’ve been proven buying opps. the us strike doesn’t change the recent earnings growth pivot higher (esp in ‘cyclicals’); or the current crude squeezing higher and its +++ implications for higher “inflation expectations” / “more energy base-effect;” or ‘better’ global growth (china and eu pmis, while em too is looking back ‘online,’ with em equities proving to be a new ‘safe haven’ for $$$ coming-out of ‘rich’ us equities). this was a global ‘call to action’ off the back of the chemical attack, and it has received praise from everybody from sens. mccain to pelosi. we (the us) called the russians before-hand to tell them (and inform their syrian counterparts as well) what we were going to do—seriously. this was a symbolic “back up, we got a big stick” reminder. the near-to-medium-term ‘risk downside’ story to me remains largely about the rates move as ‘reflation’ has broken trend line (“the” pain trade for macros and unconstrained funds has been the flattening in edz7/8, as you’re seeing in some weak march performance #’s). with that (and any congruent ‘breakdown’ in 10y rates through this 2.30 symbolic level) you just see more of that same equities trend of ‘defensives’ and ‘bond proxies’ strength / more money $$$ chasing-into this ‘secular growth’ shift (tech, discretionary, biotech), and away from ‘cyclicals’ and ‘value’ which were the stories of ‘reflation’ / h216.  a very likely blackout / lack of news on us fiscal likely over next few months won’t help rejigger animal spirits either, so you could get that long-awaited pull-back during this ‘gap’ as well, or this current story out today from axios showing that potus is ‘eyeing’ a broad shakeout of his white house staff, including replacing priebus and bannon which could drive considerable “policy surprise” risk with the us administration…which of course too could be read as a “positive” from the markets if viewed as a shift ‘away’ from populism / extreme policy views…if you’re a ‘glass half-full’ kinda guy or gal. from the near-term risk perspective, i’ve also noted the “april effect” with us equity “momentum” market neutral strategies tending to rather violently underperform, which in light of 1) current heavy allocations to 12m ‘momentum leaders’ financials and tech sectors as well as 2) the largest factor crowding risk being ‘market’ (hedge funds still near historic highs in “high beta,” with the average dollar of hedge fund long us equity capital carrying ~ 20% more market risk than the s&p 500, per alphabetaworks), it’s still possible that any downdraft in popular trades could see an exacerbated de-risking move on the inherent outsized performance impact. ironically, some ‘good news’ for risk-assets focused on ‘looser or tighter’ financial conditions is that any “fed tapering” movement around ye (stopping reinvestment policy) will actually push back the hiking trajectory / timeline. so the thought is that this is looking to be a very ‘managed’ process, one that looks to prevent any sort of violent ‘financial tightening’ that the fed and risk assets dislike. of course that’s much easier said than done. mark orsley and i have been stating in marketing visits since january that increased interest-rate risk in the back half of the year around 1) ongoing fomc hikes 2) potential for fed cessation of reinvestments into ust / mbs 3) potential for ecb ‘rhetoric shift’ towards similar ‘wind-down language’ should drive rate vol higher, which can of course spill-over into risky-assets.  the idea that you can simply remove the daily buyer of mortgages from the market since the crisis—at a time where theoretically central banks have ‘inflected tighter’—is tricky as heck to execute, because if you’re long mortgages and rates are going against you (negative convexity), your first move and really only option is to hit usts. that’s just how it works, and this convexity hedging dynamic could then of course exacerbate said rate vol, which will impact the enormous combined assets and leverage of risk-parity strategies, which will impact vol targeting / risk control strategies, as the basis of the macro construct for the past 10 years has been about “lower (rates) and flatter.” but that’s for another email on another day. now if you really want to talk about the ultimate risk-asset support…look no further than the fed minutes from earlier in the week, where the fomc again “rolled-out” their “fed put.” despite all of the talk about their “data dependency” and how the labor market was “continuing to expand” while inflation in consumer prices “was close to the committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent,” it’s clear that it is markets which dictate to the fed, and not the other way around.  this “reflexivity conundrum” (as i’ve called it for years-now post the “taper tantrum” in ’13, sadly) continues to further embolden the buying in the same em equities, hy bonds and cre prices which the fomc claims to be concerned about as being elevated. by perpetually inserting flowery prose that there could be “…downside risks to their economic projections, if, for example, financial markets were to experience a significant correction,” the fed only further “green-lights” more of the same “buy the dip” / “sell front-month vol” behavior. and as noted above and perhaps most importantly, when paired with the apparent intentions to amend the current reinvestment policy before year-end (remember, kids: “tapering is tightening”), it very clearly suddenly priced-out hikes that the market had been expecting (another “ouch” for longs in banks, and certainly not ‘music to the ears’ of my ‘reflation’ recovery hedge xlf upside / xlk downside thesis). thus, the balance of risk remains in favor of upside for now until this muscle memory above (buy risk dips, sell vol) is changed. “the” macro ‘reflation’ trade is breaking down as the edz7/8 steepener violently flattens through support: see mark’s “macro

3913,Is The Fed's Balance Sheet Headed For The Crapper?,2017-04-06 23:16:00+00:00,"authored by danielle dimartino booth, never underestimate the resourcefulness of a great plumber. had it not been for the genius of thomas crapper , champion inventor of the water-waste-preventing cistern syphon, victorians would have been left to make their trek to that malodorous darker place otherwise known as the out house, or perhaps the crockery pot stashed under the bed for a while longer. born in 1836, crapper was apprenticed to a master plumber at the tender (today) age of 14 and had hung his shingle in chelsea by his mid-twenties. such was crapper’s renown and stellar reputation, that even the royals themselves were early adopters. the prince of wales, later king edward vii, is the first known to grace the invention with his regal rear. windsor castle, buckingham palace and westminster abbey would be appointed in short order ensuring safe and sanitarily stately relief as the royal “we” traveled from castle to castle. of course, it took rude americans to nick his last name, giving future generations of boisterous boys endless joy at having a humorous potty word to reference the potty. crapper took great pride in publicly peddling his patented products. legend has it prim british ladies would faint upon happening upon his marlborough road shop, such was the shock at the sight of this and that model of the technological wonder behind huge pane glass windows. by our very nature, we are nothing if not imperfect, crapper included. one of his innovative inventions fell flat, or better put, jumped too high. it would seem his spring-loaded loo seat, which leapt upwards as derrieres ascended, automating flushing in the process, was too ill-conceived and thus ill-fated, to be purveyed after all. no one likes a rude slap on the bottom, bond market investors especially. perhaps that’s why there’s such irritability among traders who prefer clarity above all, even as bond yields flash danger ahead. just a guess here but all that angst could reflect concerns about a different sort of plumber, of the central banker ilk. it’s no secret the plumbers at the federal reserve are feverishly at work devising a way to unwind their $4.5 trillion war chest of a balance sheet. officials claim their carefully devised maneuvers will nary elicit an inkling of a disturbance in the markets they’ve coddled all these years with billions of dollars of purchases, month-in, month-out. but one must wonder, at the timing, at the ostensive optics, if nothing else. fed chair janet yellen insists that economic recoveries do not die of old age. but why chance it? unless, that is, the motivations of shrinkage are less than magnanimous and dare one say, immoral. consider the fed’s commander in chief herself. back in december 2011, then vice chair yellen pushed back against the majority of those on the federal open market committee (fomc). the time was ripe for more cowbell. she argued that “a compelling case for further policy accommodation” could be made despite visible green shoots in the labor market and business spending. the consummate dove, she added that while they were at it, why not commit to the fed sitting on its hands until late 2014 from what was then mid-2013? why yes, since you raise the subject, a presidential election was indeed a matter of months away. take a step back further in time if you will, to august 2011. though it is maintained that the subject of politics at fomc meetings is unseemly, as religion is to cocktail parties, the upcoming election was too front and center to ignore given the subject of debate among committee members. at the time, the markets were interpreting the fed’s pledge to keep interest rates tethered to the zero bound for “an extended period” as several meetings. for markets, that period of time was sufficiently brief to begin to price in an impending tightening cycle, an abhorrent assumption to the dovish coalition who had several years, not meetings, in mind. how best to broadcast the fed was anything but a commitment-phobe? that’s easy. do what the fed did throughout its foray into unconventional policymaking and guarantee results the best way econometricians can, with a numeric commitment, in this case through “mid-2013.” god love st. louis fed president james bullard for piping up with this following gem: “it will look very political to delay any rate hikes until after the election. i think that will also damage our credibility. i also doubt that we can credibly promise what this committee may or may not do two years from now.” score two for st. louis! political tinder and who the heck knows where economy will be in two years! dallas fed president richard fisher (full disclosure – the man i once simply referred to as ‘boss’) concurred: “the ‘2013’ just looks too politically convenient, and i don’t want to fall back into people being suspicious about the way we conduct our business.” according to the transcripts, former fed governor daniel tarullo offered a helping hand with the suggestion that perhaps fisher would be happier with committing all the way out to 2014. lovely. and this coming from an individual who sported his obama bumper sticker for years driving in and out of the parking garage. for the record, then chairman ben bernanke sided with the doves, defending the move to make binding for a set period the promise to keep rates on the floor. in the end, bernanke withstood three dissenting votes though not without a fight. perhaps what’s most noteworthy is that no fewer than 20 pages of transcripts are devoted to bernanke’s best efforts to quash the dissents. that’s a problem in and of itself. healthy dissent should make for a healthy institution. plus, common sense tells you markets never give back what you give. the time committed was downright irresponsible and all but set the stage for future market temper and taper tantrums. you may note that the dissenting voices of reason never prevailed, hence the aforementioned $4.5 trillion balance sheet. that’s what makes the doves’ dogged determination to tighten on two fronts so damning. it’s clear that politics got us into this monetary quagmire and that politics will also land us in recession. to be fair, recessions are inevitabilities down here on planet earth where business cycles are permitted to be cyclical. just the same, for a group of folks who’ve done backbends for years endeavoring to prolong the recovery at all costs, it’s plain odd that they’re even flirting with shrinking the very balance sheet that secures their power base as type a monetary control freaks. the good news, for those fearing having to enter monetary rehab, is that it’s going to take a mighty long time to shrink the balance sheet. the fine folks over at goldman sachs figure that getting from point a ($4.5 trillion) to point b ($2 trillion based on balance sheet contracting just over a tenth the size of the country’s gdp) will take at least five years. (an aside for you insomniacs out there: have a look back at mind the cap, penned back on december 16, 2015, released hours before the fed hiked rates for the first time in order to raise the cap on the reverse repo facility (rrp) to $2 trillion. ( mind the cap via dimartinobooth.com ) come what may, you can consider goldman’s estimate of the terminal value of a $2 trillion balance sheet and the size of the rrp to be anything but coincidental.) in any event, things change. as per goldman, by 2022, “…changes in fed leadership, regulation, treasury issuance policy, or macroeconomic conditions could alter both the near-term path and the intended terminal size of the balance sheet.” indeed. it is entertaining to watch market pundits shift in their skivvies trying to assure the masses that a shrinking balance sheet will be welcomed by risky assets. it was downright comical to read that the fed’s strategically allowing only long-dated treasuries to expire and not be replaced would prevent the yield curve from inverting, thus staving off recession. pardon the interruption, but domestic non-financial sector debt stood at about 140 percent of gdp in 1980. today, it’s crested 250 percent of gdp and keeps rising. interest rate sensitivity, especially in commercial real estate, household finance and junk bonds is particularly acute. oh, and by the way, monetary policy is a global phenomenon. at last check, the european periphery and emerging market corporate bond market were not in the best position to weather a rising rate environment. the best performance, though, was delivered by chair janet yellen herself. in the spirit of giving credit its due, business insider’s pedro da costa highlighted this delightful nugget from testimony yellen presented to congress in february: “waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the fomc to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting the financial markets and pushing the economy into recession.” isn’t the rapidly flattening yield curve communicating that ‘removing accommodation’ today is one and the same with ‘pushing the economy into recession’? in da costa’s words, this preemptive philosophy is “dubious” and akin to, “a modern-day finance version of bleeding the patient to cure it.” hope you’ll agree that leeching has no more place in modern medicine than outhouses do in our backyards. even as the fed battles its own public relations nightmare, it would seem policymakers intend to follow through on their threat to tighten on two fronts, though not concurrently. will president trump pass the test and stand firm on reinstating leaders at the fed who will transform it into a less compromised, more apolitical institution? or will trump fold, opting to keep the doves in command? it’s just a hunch, but a less-threatened fed could just as easily be expected to back down on shrinking the balance sheet. given where the economy looks headed, newly empowered doves might even be inclined to grow the balance sheet anew. stranger things or political posturing? you tell me and while you’re at it, ever noticed the word, ‘die’ is embedded in the word, ‘diet’? let’s just say bulking up is easier done than slimming down. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Ben Bernanke goldman sachs St Louis Fed Goldman Sachs Commercial Real Estate Ben Bernanke Dallas Fed Federal Reserve Yield Curve Green Shoots Testimony Janet Yellen Daniel Tarullo Monetary Policy Reverse Repo B+ Bond Fisher Richard Fisher Recession recovery St. Louis Fed Real estate,1
3932,A Key Reflation Trade Support Level Just Broke,2017-04-06 17:21:00+00:00,"while most eyes are focused on the longer-end of the curve and the butterfly-rotations in the treasury complex... rbc's mark orsley points out that there is a substantial repricing going on in the front-end that could bleed into the broader reflation theme . arguably the most popular way in rates to play reflation and the thought of a more aggressive fed has been the edz7/edz8 steepener (buying dec ’17 eurodollars/selling dec ’18 eurodollars).  conventional wisdom was the curve had 2 hikes priced in, the fed has been saying 3 hikes for 2018 so its 1 hike light and thus a buy (steepener).  fair enough and i was a believer of this theory as well.   however, dudley really threw the eurodollar market for a loop when he: as i have been saying in the past couple notes, this caused a recalculation of fed hike expectations by the eurodollar market and that caused the bleed lower in the edz7/edz8 spread. it may not look like much in the charts but we are talking about a significant move.  from the pre-march fomc high to now, that curve has fallen from 57bps to 38bps (19bps).  that is an 11 standard deviation move.  for those equity minded, it would be equivalent to s&p’s dropping 150 points (~7%). yesterday’s fomc minutes from the march meeting only exasperated the move in eurodollars. the statement that most fed officials saw reinvestments shift warranted this year was slightly more aggressive in terms of the timing that many in the market expected. thus when coupled with dudley comments, the fed is confirming that tapering is on the way which means there will be 1 or 2 less hikes than we all originally expected.  that flattens the eurodollar curve and pushes the eurodollar unwind further. so now what? i think the take away is when you look at the chart of edz7/edz8; it is the same formation as 10yrs.  while 10yrs are holding its range, eurodollar spreads are potentially foreshadowing a pending break down in yields.    e ssentially, eurodollar curves are breaking the equivalent level as the all-important 2.31% level in 10yrs which is being watched by everyone in the world. edz7/edz8 spread... looks familiar doesn’t it? we noted the critical levels on us 10yr rates ... the bottom line is, although getting a slight reprieve this morning, the breakdown in eurodollar spreads increases the probability of a support break in 10yr yields which is watched by the entire market and has repercussions beyond rates (into financial equity names and credit products to name a few). if it does break, it will likely lead to a significant round of capitulation in reflation trades.  from there, the story will turn to knock on effects and potential liquidations in other products (ie: book gains in s&p longs against losses in eurodollars). the trend line break this week in us 10yr yields to me indicates the froth being taken off the trump side of the reflation theme. if the support level at 2.31% gives way, this will mean rates will retrace to the longer term trend line first put in place post-brexit.  this post-brexit trend line represents the stronger economic data momentum (non-trump induced) and central banks pivoting away from easing themes.  those two themes still persist. it would not be unreasonable to see 2.15% by may which fills the gap from november and meets up with the longer-term uptrend that i think will end up holding. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",EuroDollar Central Banks,1
3935,NY Fed Disagrees With Minutes: Does Not Expect Balance Sheet Renormalization Until Mid-2018,2017-04-06 16:31:00+00:00,"with the question of the fed's portfolio normalization now all the rage, accentuated by yesterday's fomc minutes announcement that runoff could start later this year - even as many traders admit nobody has any idea what will happen if and when the fed starts reducing its holdings, mostly of mbs - on thursday the ny fed, the fed's trading desk, provided a glimpse into its thinking on how this will play out in its latest domestic market operations annual report . according to the report, the fed's bond holdings could drop to about $2.8 trillion by the end of 2021 - a $1.7 trillion reduction over the next 5 years - with the new york fed now projecting its balance sheet will reach a ""normalized"" state some two quarter earlier however with approximately $600 billion more assets than in a year-ago estimate. the u.s. central bank currently has some $4.5 trillion in treasury and mortgage bonds. to be sure, many things can and will happen between now and 2021, including the us may have a new president. which is why what we found more interesting was the ny fed's own forecast on the start of renormalization, which disagreed with the fomc minutes, in that bill dudley's fed does not expect the fed to start ""renormalizing"" until mid-2018, to wit: "" the size of the soma portfolio is projected to remain largely unchanged at its current level of approximately $4.2 trillion through mid-2018, while full reinvestments continue. "" what happens to the balance sheet then: after that date, it starts to decline as reinvestments are phased out and then ended altogether in mid-2019. the federal reserve’s securities holdings then decline until the portfolio reaches its normalized size in the fourth quarter of 2021 (chart 26). at that time, the domestic securities portfolio is estimated to be about $2.8 trillion, with a slightly higher concentration in treasury securities than in agency mbs. thereafter, treasury-driven growth of securities holdings supports trend balance sheet growth, and agency debt and agency mbs holdings continue to run off. the ny fed on suspension of reinvestments vs outright selling: once the fomc ends reinvestments, the pace of the reduction in the size of the soma portfolio will largely be driven by the pace of principal receipts from soma securities holdings (chart 27). the timing of principal payments from maturing treasury securities and agency debt securities is a known function of current soma holdings. in contrast, projected principal pay-downs associated with agency mbs are model-based estimates that are subject to considerable uncertainty because of the embedded prepayment option. the actual pay-down path will depend on a variety of factors, including the path of interest rates, changes in housing prices, credit conditions, and other government policy initiatives. finally, how the latest forecast differs from last years: the point of normalization in late 2021 is projected to occur almost two quarters earlier than in the 2015 baseline (chart 28). the balance sheet starts to contract just over a year later than it was expected to in the 2015 baseline given a longer-than-previously anticipated period for reinvestments to continue. (the december 2015 baseline was modeled on an assumption that reinvestments would begin to be phased out in the first half of 2017.) ho wever, a larger long-run balance sheet size in the current baseline, driven by the assumption about a higher level of reserve balance liabilities in a future policy implementation framework, requires less of the portfolio to run off once such a contraction starts. and some parting words: of course, banks’ demand for reserves and the level of reserves the fomc will choose to maintain in its long-run policy implementation framework remain uncertain. a set of alternative scenarios highlights  the sensitivity of soma portfolio balances to different long-run levels of federal reserve liabilities. these scenarios illustrate the degree to which increases (decreases) in liabilities imply a larger (smaller)  level of the soma in the long run and how long it might take to achieve a normalized portfolio size. while the projections are modeled with regard to alternative levels of reserve balances, the specific type  of liability is not material; the effect on soma portfolio balances would be similar if the alternative levels of liabilities arose from changes in other line items, such as federal reserve notes, the tga, the  foreign repo pool, or dfmu balances. under a scenario in which reserve balances are $100 billion in the long run (the baseline in prior years’ reports), the size of the balance sheet is normalized in the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately one  year later than in the baseline scenario (chart 29). in contrast, under a scenario in which reserves are $1 trillion in the long run, the size of the balance sheet is normalized in the fourth quarter of 2020 ,  nearly one year sooner than in the baseline. given that treasury purchases resume at an earlier date, by the end of the forecast horizon the portfolio is more heavily weighted to treasury securities than it is  in the baseline scenario. in other words, if all goes according to plan, the fed will consider its ""renormalization"" mission complete in about 5 years, at which point it will have no qualms about launching even more qe if it has to. source tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Baseline Scenario New York Fed Federal Reserve Housing Prices Credit Conditions Agency MBS Bond,1

"" below are key excerpts from his overnight note: the focus of fomc minutes was on when/how to start the process of reducing the fed's balance sheet. there was nothing to change the view that 2017 will see three rate hikes, but if rate hikes happen concurrently with a shrinking fed balance sheet, that may have an impact on the terminal funds rate. 1yr rates in 5 years' time are now priced at 2.55%, 30bp below their highs for the year and the sense is that the fed isn't that bothered about a market which prices a lower terminal rate than the ‘dot-plot' suggests. this matters for two reasons. firstly, what matters for the dollar now that the rate-hiking cycle is underway is not how many hikes we get this year (or next) but where the fed's going in the longer run. and secondly, it's important for the path of longer-dated treasury yields. the dollar gets not help from the fed if we're collectively tempted to revise terminal funds down rather than up. and with 10s still flirting furiously with the bottom of their 4-month range, the danger of a break lower's clear. the most immediate direct impact of this is on usd/jpy. if i'm a long-standing long-term usd/jpy bull, then i'm a short-term rabbit. 110 won't hold if 2.30 breaks in 10s and nor will 109, and so on... the wider fed debate is about the impact on risk assets of shrinking the balance sheet. if near-zero rates and central bank buying of bonds have been the fundamental driver of global capital towards higher-yielding assets, then reversing both parts of this can't be helpful. which is how markets have reacted overnight. the caveat though, is that the fomc minutes got to great pains to stress that any move will be gradual and predictable, and accomplished mainly by phasing out reinvestment of maturing bonds. if i weigh a low terminal funds rate against a super-cautious and very drawn-out normalisation of the fed's balance sheet, i can't really see reason to worry about crowding-out of capital from emerging markets. i still worry much more about over-accommodative policy and ever-rising debt. so, a risk wobble today but no change in trend. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",SocGen,1
3946,"Global Stocks Rebound From Overnight Lows, On Edge Ahead Of Trump-Xi Meeting",2017-04-06 11:41:00+00:00,"s&p futures are little changed at 6am et, trading at 2347.55 and paring an earlier 0.4 percent drop, on the back of the usdjpy ramp which for the second day in a row has emerged alongside the european open, just as the key 110 support level appears in danger, soothing concerns about the fed's balance sheet reduction and ""some"" fed officials warning that stocks have gotten expensive. the s&p plunged in the last 90 minutes of trading on wednesday led by banks and energy companies. while asian stocks fall in early trading, european bourses rebounded from session lows alongside the s&p and usdjpy. in europe, media, bank and insurers lead the decline but have since cut their losses as the market's attention shifts to the upcoming summit between trump and xi. ahead of mar-a-lago meeting, central banks remained the dominant theme for markets on thursday, with traders troubled by the prospect of a shrinking fed balance sheet and the euro briefly tumbling then recouping much of its losses after mario draghi reaffirmed ecb monetary policy. specifically, the ecb's president warned thursday that it was too early to reduce the bank's massive monetary stimulus, despite signs of strength in the eurozone economy, and pushed back against suggestions that the ecb might raise interest rates soon. top ecb officials have sent out mixed messages in recent days on whether the central bank is ready to wind down sweeping stimulus measures such as its eur2.3 trillion ($2.5 trillion) bond-purchase program and subzero interest rates. as a result, market expectations for an ecb rate hike in one year have declined sharply over the past two weeks. investor expectations that the ecb could raise the cost of borrowing as early as january 2018 had increased after draghi’s march 9 press conference. governing council members from austria’s ewald nowotny to the netherlands’ klaas knot and italy’s ignazio visco, as well as executive board member benoit coeure, had voiced to different degrees openness to a change in sequencing. as has often been the case, draghi's commentary was quickly defused by comments from the bundesbank's own jens weidmann who said “given the prospect of a continuous, robust economic recovery in the euro area and an increase in price pressure, the discussion on when the governing council should consider monetary policy normalization and how it could adjust its communication accordingly in advance is legitimate."" weidmann adds that “there is agreement within the governing council that an expansive monetary policy stance is currently appropriate” yet one can “be of different opinions about the correct degree of monetary policy expansion. i could have imagined a less expansive monetary policy, especially as many economic indicators are developing positively.” the currency impact was as follows: europe's stoxx 600 index headed for its first retreat in three days as s&p 500 futures steadied. treasury yields pared some of wednesday’s drop, which was triggered by the fed's warning it would reduce its balance sheet before year end, damping the need for interest-rate hikes. as bloomberg notes , the fed minutes did little to alter market views on the bank’s assessment of the economy, but the discussion on shrinking the $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year underscored prospects for a drop in global liquidity. the message once again contrasted with that of the central bank in europe, where draghi said on thursday “continued support for demand remains key.” ""most portfolio managers think equities are the most overbought in 20 years and so anything that creates some kind of concern, well, it is an excuse to take profits,"" said pictet asset management's chief strategist luca paolini. he was referring to minutes of the fed's last meeting that showed most of the u.s. central bank's policymakers thought it should begin trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year, earlier than many had expected. some fed members also ""viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures,"" a rare comment on asset levels that also caught investors off guard. “if near-zero rates and central bank buying of bonds have been the fundamental driver of global capital towards higher-yielding assets, then reversing both parts of this can’t be helpful,” kit juckes, a global strategist at societie generale, wrote in a note. “which is how markets have reacted overnight.” broader sentiment had also been bruised overnight when u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said there was no consensus on tax reform and it would take longer to accomplish than healthcare. markets have risen in recent months in part on speculation fiscal stimulus would boost u.s. growth and inflation. ""trump's agenda is falling to pieces,"" said pictet's paolini. ""and that is probably the main concern (for stock market investors)."" the stoxx europe 600 index fell 0.2 percent after closing little changed on wednesday. futures on the s&p 500 were modestly in the green adter declining 0.4% earlier in the session. the whiplash in sentiment saw japan's nikkei hit its lowest since early december. australia's index also lost 0.5 percent. shanghai .ssec made marginal gains as a private survey of china's service sector showed activity expanded at its slowest pace in six months in march. ""we were hit by a bucket of cold water,"" said norihiro fujito, senior investment strategist at mitsubishi ufj morgan stanley securities. ""signs that the fed could pare its balance sheet are shocking enough, but the mood was exacerbated as the fed touched upon stock valuations, which is very rare."" today the focus turns to president trump’s two-day meeting with china president xi jingping at trump’s estate in florida. there don’t appear to be any scheduled press conferences just yet but it’s worth keeping an eye on the headlines as the next two days progress. clearly north korea will be a subject near to the top of the agenda. importantly though the meeting is the start of a new china-us bilateral relationship so the rhetoric which follows from the leaders will be closely scrutinised and debated one would imagine. topping the agenda at trump's mar-a-lago resort in florida will be whether he makes good on his threat to use u.s.-china trade ties to pressure beijing to do more to rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor north korea. nerves were not helped when u.s. pacific fleet commander admiral scott swift said any decision on a pre-emptive attack against north korea would be up to trump. investors also remain focused on health care and tax policy in washington, with house speaker paul ryan saying the chances for a vote on a revised repeal of obamacare this week were dwindling. ryan also said tax reform could take longer, reuters reported. the bloomberg dollar index returned to gains as gold and oil pared declines and the euro was little changed. initial jobless claims data due. market snapshot top overnight news asia equity markets traded negative following a similar downbeat us close amid weakness in the energy sector and in the wake of the fed minutes, which showed that the fed discussed normalization of the balance sheet and that some officials viewed stock prices as quite high. asx 200 (-0.5%) suffered from losses in the financial sector, while nikkei 225 (-1.4%) was the laggard in the region on jpy strength as usd/jpy failed to maintain 111.00. hang seng (-0.7%) and shanghai comp. (+0.1%) were mixed as participants digest the latest chinese caixin services and composite pmi figures which printed at 6-month lows, but remained in expansionary territory. 10yr jgbs traded marginally higher amid a subdued risk tone in stocks, while today's enhanced liquidity auction super-long jgbs drew greater interest with the b/c increasing from prior. chinese caixin services pmi (mar) 52.2 (prey. 52.6); 6-month low. (newswires) chinese caixin composite pmi (mar) 52.1 (prey. 52.6); 6-month low. pboc refrained from conducting open market operations for the 8th consecutive day. top asian news european equities initially traded with a risk-off bias following the decline in us and asian bourses after the fomc minutes showed that members were concerned over the strength in stock markets as some participants viewed equity prices as ""quite high"". while the minutes also showed that officials were split on whether higher inflation warranted faster hikes now or a more gradual pace. as such,  financial names have been hardest hit across europe, while the weakness in crude futures has weighed on the energy sector. the flight to quality trade has been felt in credit markets, with bond yields trending lower this morning. however, the gains in eurozone bond prices have been curbed by supply from spain and france. in terms of how the supply was digested, both were received well by the market with french paper managing to survive any political concerns in the region as the usual buyers managed to step up to the plate as expected. top european news: in currencies, the bloomberg dollar spot index added 0.1 percent at 10:45 a.m. in london following a 0.1 percent drop wednesday. the euro erased earlier gains to trade little changed. the south african rand regained some ground after recent declines to trade 0.1 percent higher. usd/jpy has again tested down into the low 110.00's, but we continue to run into buyers ahead the figure, and will likely do so as long as the key 10yr yield holds off 2.30%. this will rest on wall street to a notable degree, with european bourses modestly lower so far this morning. we have also seen eur/jpy dip under 118.00 again, but the recovery looks temporary as does the pullback off the euft/usd lows this morning, where sub 1.0650 has been retested. we have the ecb  inutes later today, but president draghi has already reassured the market that there further evidence/confidence required before altering the current monetary policy stance, but the eur dip was short lived. this impact on eur/gbp also, testing down to 0.8500 but holding off the figure and rebounding sharply to suggest some sizeable buy orders ahead. cable is caught between 1.2400 and 1.2500 as a result, but the tight trade in gbp near term is perhaps also reflective of the lack of gauge in uk-eu negotiations to come. in commodities, wti crude erased an earlier drop to trade little changed at $51.17 a barrel; data on wednesday showed u.s. output rose for a seventh week and inventories expanded to a fresh record. gold fell 0.2 percent to $1,253.38 an ounce.  commodity markets have much to contend with amid the political backdrop, heightened by the meeting between respective presidents trump and xi jinping. nevertheless, fresh hopes of chinese demand continue to bolster base metals near term, with copper edging higher but tentatively so as usd2.70 nears. on the day, zinc is outperforming, but few specific drivers to point to with the overhang of the 'above. oil prices have managed to stabilise after the surprise doe build reported yesterday, having dipped below usd51.00. a tentative recovery as yet. precious metals continue to move with treasuries, and in line with this, risk sentiment adds some support which ties in with the dip in us yields. looking at the day ahead, we will get the latest ecb minutes followed by us data which includes the latest weekly initial jobless claims report. the other important event today is the earlier mentioned meeting between president trump and china president xi jinping. us event calendar db's jim reid summaries the overnight wrap where did it all go wrong for us equities last night after a strong session before the last 2 hours? well the fomc minutes and comments from house speaker ryan seemed to turn a +0.76% gain to a closing -0.31% loss in the s&p 500. the sections of the minutes that concerned the market were “some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures” and also that “prices of other risk assets, such as emerging market stocks, high yield corporate bonds, and commercial real estate, had also risen significantly in recent months”. the more talked about subject in the market leading into the minutes was what fed officials were thinking about the balance sheet debate. the minutes revealed that “provided that the economy continued to perform about as expected, most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee’s reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year”. meanwhile the discussion around fiscal policy suggested that stimulus expectations have been pushed out by some officials to 2018 which matches what the fed’s evans had said last week. indeed the minutes showed that “participants continued to underscore the considerable uncertainty about the timing and nature of potential changes to fiscal policies as well as the size of the effects of such changes on economic activity”. the text then went on to say that “however, several participants now anticipated that meaningful fiscal stimulus would likely not begin until 2018” and that in light of this “about half of the participants did not incorporate explicit assumptions about fiscal policies in their projections”. meanwhile the ryan comments emerged in a reuters article in which he was quoted as saying that tax reforms will take longer to accomplish than the repeal and replacement of obamacare. ryan also said that “the house has a (tax reform) plan but the senate doesn’t quite have one yet” and “so even the three entities aren’t on the same page yet”. separate to this ryan also confirmed that the house will not reach a deal on healthcare before the start of the two week break with a congressman official also confirming that “we are going to go home tomorrow without a deal”. treasury yields had topped out at 2.382% for the 10y just prior to the minutes and ryan comments yesterday before falling sharply into the close to end the day down 2.5bps at 2.336%. it was a similar story at the front end too with 2y yields ending the day down 1.8bps at 1.236%. the dollar index finished more or less unchanged after paring a move higher of as much as +0.30% while gold bounced all the way back after being down as much as -1.00%. the other big mover in the commodity complex was oil where wti oil had at one stage traded as high as $51.88/bbl and over +1.50% higher intraday. however the latest eia data revealed that crude stockpiles rose to another record high last week which sent oil prices sharply lower with wti back below $51/bbl this morning. today the focus turns to president trump’s two-day meeting with china president xi jingping at trump’s estate in florida. there don’t appear to be any scheduled press conferences just yet but it’s worth keeping an eye on the headlines as the next two days progress. clearly north korea will be a subject near to the top of the agenda. importantly though the meeting is the start of a new china-us bilateral relationship so the rhetoric which follows from the leaders will be closely scrutinised and debated one would imagine. ahead of that markets in asia this morning appear to be largely following the lead from that weaker momentum into the wall street close last night. the nikkei (-1.40%) has been the big mover this morning, not helped by a slightly stronger yen (which has touched the highest since mid-november), while the hang seng (-0.50%), asx (-0.62%) and kospi (-0.53%) are also down. bourses in china are however flat as we go to print. that is despite the caixin pmi in china falling 0.4pts to 52.2 in march and the lowest level since september. us equity futures are also currently in the red. moving on. while the fomc minutes and ryan comments largely dominated the focus for markets yesterday there was also some important data to digest. indeed helping to support the initial positive sentiment in markets was the march adp employment report which revealed a significant 263k gain in private payrolls. that was well above the consensus forecast for 185k and although there was a 53k downward revision to the february reading the three month average has still risen to a healthy 259k which paints a positive picture ahead of payrolls tomorrow. in contrast there was some disappointment in the ism non-manufacturing print for last month which declined 2.4pts at the headline to 55.2 (vs. 57.0 expected) and the lowest since october while the final services pmi was also revised down 0.1pts to 52.8. in the details of the former the employment component tumbled 3.6pts to 51.6 which is actually the lowest reading since august while new orders dipped 2.3pts, albeit to a still solid 58.9. over in europe the main focus was also on the final pmi revisions. the final services reading for the euro area was revised down half a point to 56.0 which as a result saw the composite scaled back 0.3pts to 56.4. that softer services reading was largely as a result of a 1pt downward revision in france to 57.5 with germany left unchanged at 55.6. in italy the services pmi declined 1.5pts to 52.9 (vs. 54.3 expected) while in spain the pmi came in at 57.4 and marginally down on february. all told our economists in europe noted that notwithstanding the slight retreat in the reading the euro area pmis still suggest clear upside to their moderate growth forecasts in q1. indeed they note that the data points to growth of 0.6% to 0.7% qoq versus their 0.3% to 0.4% projection which reflects more mixed hard data of late. for completeness the services pmi in the uk yesterday was solid at 55.0 for march which represents an uplift of 1.7pts. that helped the ftse 100 to close up +0.13% while the stoxx 600 finished +0.02% after paring gains into the close. staying with europe for a second, it’s worth noting the comments from ecb governing council member weidmann yesterday. in an interview with die zeit, weidmann said that it is getting closer to a time when the ecb should “not have the foot pressed down on the gas pedal, but to lift it slightly”. the article also suggested that weidmann would welcome bond purchases stopping in one year and that the economic recovery in the euro area is robust and will continue. so fairly hawkish, although not too dissimilar to the timing implied by the ecb. interestingly there was no comment or mention about depo policy which has been more topical of late. looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe it’s fairly quiet with factory orders data in germany the only release of note. ecb president draghi is also due to speak in frankfurt at 8am bst when he makes opening remarks at the annual ‘ecb and its watchers conference’ so that might be worth keeping an eye on. the ecb’s praet will also speak at the event as will the fed’s williams at 2.30pm bst. away from that we will then get the latest ecb minutes just after midday followed by us data which includes the latest weekly initial jobless claims report. the other important event today is the earlier mentioned meeting between president trump and china president xi jinping. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [

3947,"Cudmore: ""It's Now A Matter Of When, Not If, Markets Break Down""",2017-04-06 10:44:00+00:00,"after yesterday's sudden last hour swoon, in which the djia tumbled over 200 points after the fomc minutes, the biggest intraday reversal in 14 months, suddenly the bears - especially those who until recently were on the fences - are getting more vocal, such as mark cudmore, bloomberg's former fx trader who this morning writes that ""it’s now a matter of when, not if, markets break down into a proper bout of risk-aversion."" as for timing, he sayd that ""we’re debating the hour rather than the week."" his full note: the markets have made their negative feelings clear it’s now a matter of when, not if, markets break down into a proper bout of risk-aversion . as for timing, we’re debating the hour rather than the week. the catalyst might be headlines from the trump-xi summit, or the ecb’s comments, or it might be the labor report tomorrow, or something else entirely. it doesn’t matter. markets have made clear which way they want to go, they just haven’t picked which catalyst they’ll blame. it’s not about where assets are priced today -- the key levels have still not broken -- it’s the path they followed to arrive there. after the strong adp jobs report, equities rallied, treasuries fell, the yen slumped, etc. the moves were powerful enough to squeeze out weak risk-asset bears and breed complacency among bulls . then the fed minutes were delivered. the reversals were sharp and just at the moment when nobody was thinking of the downside to risk assets. this means the market will have to chase these moves. but not aggressively quite yet -- most traders will now be nervously watching the ranges and counting on them to hold again. the key remains the 2.3% yield level in 10-year treasuries . with the fed intimating that balance sheet reduction may come sooner than investors expected, thereby potentially reducing the pace of rate hikes, that market is fundamentally fragile as well. it’s tempting to argue that, no matter all that has been thrown at markets in recent months -- from a fed hike to the failure of the health-care bill -- the ranges still hold. it’s this attitude that has only raised their relevance and increased the likely volatility when they cleanly break. i’d be surprised if the levels survive thursday, let alone until the weekend. the tide has already turned and we’re soon going to see who is swimming naked. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",headlines ADP Jobs Report Volatility Yen ETC,1
3971,Stocks Tumble: Fed Spooks Traders With Bubble Warning,2017-04-05 21:05:00+00:00,"was today the yellen fed's irrational exuberance moment? it started off so well: the blistering adp payrolls report, the highest in over two years (despite disappointing pmi and ism reports), sent stocks soaring off the bat with the dow jumping nearly 200 points higher, rising as high as 20,887, and the s&p knocking on the all time high 2,400 door again, and amzn to new all tim highs, and making some wonder if the reflation trade had returned. it was not meant to be, because while it took the market some time to digest the fed's minutes, the fomc delivered one of its loudest warnings to date that it was focusing not so much on inflation or employment, but was seeking to deflate what even ""some members"" of the fomc agree is a stock bubble, warning that stock prices are ""quite high"", and warning that its forecasts face ""downside risks"" if ""financial markets were to experience a significant correction."" from the minutes: ""a few participants attributed the recent equity price appreciation to expectations for corporate tax cuts or to increased risk tolerance among investors rather than to expectations of stronger economic growth. some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures ."" then, more ominously, this: ... a number of participants remarked that recent and prospective changes in financial conditions posed upside risks to their economic projections, to the extent that financial developments provided greater stimulus to spending than currently anticipated , as well as downside risks to their economic projections if, for example, financial markets were to experience a significant correction. it took algos a while to process what the fed was really saying, which is why while the dollar briefly spiked to the day’s highs in kneejerk reaction to the minutes, it then surrendered all gains and then some after the minutes showed most officials backed a policy change that would begin shrinking the central bank’s balance sheet, as wellas warn explicitly about valuations. the weakness in the dollar meant that everyone's favorite market-influencing carry pair would likewise suffer, and after breaking out above 111, the usdjpy tumbled as low as 110.70 once again threatening the key 110 support level. of course, with both the dollar and usdjpy tumbling, it was gold's turn to shine and it did just that, surging virtually uninterrupted since its post-minutes kneejerk selloff. oil did not help, because after rising to multi-week highs this morning, wti promptly tumbled after the doe not only rejected yesterday's api draw report, but showed yet another record in commercial oil stocks coupled with the latest weekly increase in us crude production. the result: crude slumped back under $51, once again driving a dagger through the heart of the reflation trade. across the rates complex, if it was the fed's intention to orchestrate a smooth selloff, it failed: having failed to selloff earlier in the day as rbc discussed, yields briefly spiked higher after the minutes only to eventually grind to session lows. as for stocks, with the most shorted universe soaring in early trading, dragging the russell higher, this too was pummeled on all sides after the fed's stark warning, prompting an accelerated liquidation of the most overvalued stock group, as shorts reasserted themselves. not even that poster child of the fed's latest bubble, amazon, could withstand the selling and after hitting all time highs in early trade, was aggressively sold off. to be sure, the selloff could have been far worse if it wasn't for some aggressive buying programs, emanating perhaps from the ny fed's arms-length market market citadel, or some other central bank, which nonetheless was unable to prevent the day's substantial gains from becoming losses. in fact, the sharp move lower, which wiped out more than 200 points from the djia, was the sharpest intraday reversal in 14 months. and yes, for those asking, the dow jones closed at the lows. we need to check but this may be the first time in many years the djia has done this minutes day. in short: today was a mess for the bulls, although it could have been much worse. however with the reflation trade now hobbled again , with trump set to meet xi perhaps unleashing another diplomatic fiasco, with payrolls looming - and after today's adp number, friday can only disappoint - there is a slew of downside risks on the immediate horizon, coming at a time when the fed itself is warning that the s&p is too damn high . and in this painfully illiquid market, all that it would take is for someone big to start selling. of course, everyone knows that the fed will not let stocks drop too low before it re-engages the qe4 ""jawbone"" machine. the only question is "" how low is too low"" ... tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Citadel Irrational Exuberance Crude,1
3976,"FOMC Minutes: Balance Sheet To Shrink This Year; Some Saw Stock Prices As ""Quite High""",2017-04-05 19:08:00+00:00,"as previewed, the focus on the just released fed minutes was on two things: the path of the rate hike, which the fed said it can change its assessment if warranted, and on the future of the fed's balance sheet, where the fomc said said a reinvestment shift was warranted, suggesting that a balance sheet reduction would likely begin later this year. key excerpts: to be sure, this is hardly the news the bond complex wanted, which has sold off following this latest warning that the fed may begin shrinking its balance sheet. however the biggest surprise was in the latest caution by ""some"" fed members that stock prices are quite high, and that the fed is increasingly worried about asset bubbles, to wit: here is the section in question: in their discussion of recent developments in financial markets, participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative despite the rise in longer-term interest rates in recent months and continued to support the expansion of economic activity. many participants discussed the implications of the rise in equity prices over the past few months, with several of them citing it as contributing to an easing of financial conditions . a few participants attributed the recent equity price appreciation to expectations for corporate tax cuts or to increased risk tolerance among investors rather than to expectations of stronger economic growth. some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures. and this: ""stock prices rose across most industries, and equity prices for financial firms outperformed broader indexes. meanwhile, spreads of yields on bonds issued by nonfinancial corporations over those on comparable-maturity treasury securities were little changed."" and then the punchline, which confirms that the fed is only focused on the s&p: the fed explicitly warns of ""downside risks"" to its forecasts if ""financial markets were to experience a significant correction."" the passage in question: ... a number of participants remarked that recent and prospective changes in financial conditions posed upside risks to their economic projections, to the extent that financial developments provided greater stimulus to spending than currently anticipated, as well as downside risks to their economic projections if, for example, financial markets were to experience a significant correction . participants also mentioned potential developments abroad that could have adverse implications for the u.s. economy. * * * below are selected excerpts from the fomc meeting minutes that concluded on march 15, via bbg: * * * and the full minutes ( link ): tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China Commercial Real Estate Agency MBS Bond Real estate,1
3977,FOMC Minutes Preview,2017-04-05 18:35:00+00:00,"with the march fomc minutes due out shortly, here are the key items to focus on, courtesy of ransquawk which reminds us that at the march meeting, the fomc decided to hike rates by 25bps, the third hike of the tightening cycle, taking the rate to 0.75%-1.00%. although the fed signalled further tightening this year, markets had expected the fed to indicate four hikes in 2017, however, the median stayed at three and market expectations for four or more hikes declined. as a result, the minutes will be scoured for clues on why the fed decided to push forward with hiking rates at this meeting but not signal a faster path to the neutral rate, which they kept at 3.0%. markets will also be looking for the fed to give any hints on what it will take for the fed to raise rates for a fourth time in the cycle. a key topic for the fed recently has been about how and when they will shrink the balance. minneapolis fed president kashkari dissented at the decision for two reasons; firstly, key data hadn't changed since the prior meeting, and secondly, because he would have preferred the fed to publish a plan on balance sheet normalisation before the next rate hike. the fed announced that they have begun the discussion about normalisation at the latest meeting but at the moment the details are scarce so the minutes should at least give a hint on timing. recently, harker said reinvestments may be appropriate at the end of 2017 but timing will depend on how the economy evolves. dudley said the reinvestments could also start late this year. dudley also added that when normalisation starts, that could be a substitute for short-term rate hikes, meaning that if the fed does begin to wind down the balance sheet then rate increases might be postponed. the fed will be wary of creating a situation similar to that observed during the taper tantrum in 2013 when the then fed chair bernanke spooked markets by suggesting that qe would end abruptly. soc gen strategist rajappa writes, ""people are not paying nearly as much attention to or pricing-in the potential impact of fed tapering reinvestments."" in summary, the 4 key things to keep an eye on, via the wsj : federal reserve officials are zeroing in on a strategy to begin winding down their $4.5 trillion portfolio of mortgage and treasury securities, possibly later this year, as part of their broader effort to wind down their extraordinary postcrisis stimulus efforts. the approach would involve raising rates two more times this year and then pausing rate moves while they start reducing the holdings, also called the balance sheet, in a gradual way. will the fed change its outlook on the balance of risks facing the economy? for years, central bankers around the world have worried more about the possibility the economy could perform worse than forecast than the chance it could perform better than expected. the fed, in its statement after the march meeting, said the near-term risks to the economy appeared “roughly balanced.” but officials have been a touch sunnier in recent public statements, noting more often the possibility it could grow faster than expected because of its own momentum or rising stock prices or possible new economic policies from the trump administration and congress. the minutes could clarify their differences. officials indicated at the march meeting they remained on track to raise short-term rates two more times this year, but didn’t indicate when they expected to move. the minutes could signal whether they could move as soon as their meetings in may or in june. nearly seven in 10 economists surveyed by the wall street journal last month said they expect the next rate increase in june. nearly seven in 10 economists surveyed by the wall street journal last month said they expect the next rate increase in june. fed officials have kept a close eye on the white house and capitol hill as they assess the likelihood of tax cuts, regulatory changes, spending increases or other policies that could boost economic growth and potentially drive up inflation. washington hasn’t offered much clarity. the minutes of their january meeting showed officials were split over whether they should begin planning for such fiscal stimulus or wait for more concrete details on policy proposals. the minutes of the march meeting could offer new insight into whether they expect action soon. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",White House March FOMC Federal Reserve Wall Street Journal RANSquawk,1
3998,"China Surge, Rising Oil Push Global Stocks Higher; S&P Futures Flat As Fed Minutes Loom",2017-04-05 11:37:00+00:00,"european stocks rebounded after a downbeat start, aided by a return to the post-euro open momentum ignition in the usdjpy while asian stocks rose after china shares surged 1.5%, the most since august. for now s&p futures are fractionally in the red, although we expect them to turn progressively higher as us traders get to their desks to frontrun the now traditional ""post open"" ramp. treasuries steadied ahead of today's fed minutes release and tomorrow's key weekly political event, the first meeting between trump and china's president. elsewhere, oil continued its rise while gold declined from a multi-week high. in an otherwise quiet session, china was the outlier as the shanghai composite index rose 1.48%, the most since august, while taiwan’s taiex advanced 1.4 percent as both markets reopened after a holiday. china announced saturday it would develop an economic zone in xiongan, hebei province, prompting prospective buyers to throng to the region, snapping up local construction companies many of which soared by the daily 10% limit, while commodities such as coking coal, iron ore and steel rebar soaring. source: @yuantalks for once it was not the us but france that grabbed the political spotlight, where last night we had the second of three live televised presidential debates. as db's jim reid recounts, much like the first it tested viewers’ stamina again with the clock running close to 4 hours in the end. in terms of the key takeaways the general feeling was that it was the six less popular candidates which largely stole the show, frequently questioning and attacking the front runners. of the candidates in contention, macron was largely on the defensive for most of the night, standing his ground but never seemingly coming under too much pressure. melenchon was the most attacking. fillon failed to really standout and took on a barrage of attacks on ethics and hamon was largely in the shadows. le pen was heavily questioned at times and looked under pressure and very much in defence-first mode. le pen’s comments were also typically defiant and she closed out by making remarks including to “take back our sovereignty”, “civilisation in danger” and also “the owners of their country with the right to a border”. in terms of the early results an elabe poll covering 1,024 viewers following the debate found that melenchon was seen as the most convincing with 25% of the votes followed in order by macron (21%), fillon (15%) and le pen (11%). a separate opinionway survey had melenchon, macron and fillon all tied on 18% a piece followed by le pen with 11%. so that result would suggest that the debate has done little to further le pen’s chances with the elabe pollster highlighting that the fierce competition on the anti-european issues contributed to le pen’s mediocre score. as we said following the first debate though, hilary clinton was seen as the comfortable winner in all the us presidential debates so it’s worth taking these results in context. interestingly leading into the debate yesterday the 2y oat-bund spread hit a near 5-year high at 47bps, surpassing the high from earlier the year in february when the spread hit 42bps. to be fair this might be as much to do with the supply and demand issues for bunds as anything else. in any case, with polls showing marine le pen was far from convincing at the latest french presidential debate, risk-off sentiment has lost momentum and risk reversals in eur/jpy have kept moving higher. two-week volatility smile steepens in favor of eur calls, while puts on two-month tenor flatten slightly. global markets may have reflected some of this with the the msci all-country world index climbed 0.1 percent. the stoxx europe 600 added 0.2 percent after fluctuating between gains and losses. futures on the s&p 500 index were little changed. the underlying gauge advanced 0.1 percent on tuesday. crude continued its advance before doe oil inventory data which is expected to show u.s. stockpiles retreated from a record. west texas intermediate

and markets remain in a holding pattern, awaiting the next major catalyst to either end or extend the global rally that pushed stocks to a record last month. a series of major data releases this week, culminating in a payrolls report friday forecast to show 175,000 jobs added by u.s. employers in march,  is offering clues to the strength of the world’s biggest economy. as reuters notes, the dollar lost its grip on earlier gains as concerns over a north korean missile test worsened sentiment ahead of the summit between the u.s. and chinese leaders. topping the agenda at trump’s mar-a-lago resort in florida will be whether he makes good on his threat to use u.s.-china trade ties to pressure beijing to do more to rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor north korea, which is working to develop missiles capable of hitting the united states. the dollar index, which tracks the u.s. currency against a trade-weighted basket of six peers, was down on the day at 100.48 , as slumping u.s. treasury yields also gave investors little incentive to buy dollars. ""the meetings are expected to be informal, unscripted discussions of how the two countries will address, but not immediately resolve, their differences,"" said strategists at morgan stanley in a note to clients. ""any commentary on how the us specifically wants to try to reduce the trade deficit with china will be watched by fx investors,"" the strategists wrote. meanwhile, oil climbed to a near one-month high on signs of a gradual tightening in global oil inventories and on concern about a supply outage at a field in the united kingdom's north sea that feeds into an international benchmark price. brent crude futures the international benchmark for oil, were up 1 percent at $54.73 per barrel. u.s. west texas intermediate (wti) crude futures was also up 1 percent. london copper rallied as chinese traders returned from a two-day break to buy up metals following brighter global manufacturing reports. zinc and nickel tracked a rally in steel. safe-haven gold steadied helped by sluggish moves in riskier assets. spot gold edged up 0.1 percent. key near-term catalyst include minutes from the fed’s march meeting, scheduled to be released wednesday, and a similar account of the ecb’s latest policy gathering is due thursday. china’s president will meet his u.s. counterpart for two days starting thursday. u.s. non-farm payrolls are due friday. bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot top overnight news from bloomberg asia equity markets traded choppy following the mild gains on wall st. which was led by the energy sector after wti crude futures reclaimed the usd 51/bbl level to the upside. asx 200 (+0.3%) swung between gains and losses as strength in commodity-related sectors was counterbalanced by losses in financials, while nikkei 225 (+0.3%) saw a similar indecisive tone as usd/jpy and jpy-crosses teetered. hang seng (+0.3%) and shanghai comp. (+1.5%) were higher on return from holiday despite the pboc refraining from liquidity injections, with the mainland outperforming amid strength in materials after a 7% surge in coking coal prices due to supply concerns following cyclone debbie. 10yr jgbs traded flat amid an indecisive tone in the region, while the boj's presence in the market for a respectable jpy 1.135t1n of jgbs failed to spur demand, as the bank also slightly reduced its buying in 1yr-3yr maturities. pboc refrained from conducting open market operations today, for a net drain of cny 90bin. top asia news energy and material names have soared in early trade to see the commodity-heavy ftse outperform its european counterparts on what has been an otherwise dreary morning for equities. other than the ftse 100, indices are flat across europe, with little in the terms of a tangible trend in direction so far this week. on a more macro scale, services pmis have been the main focus of the session, with french and eurozone readings both printing lower than the preliminary readings, however any impact on financial markets has been offset by the german composite beating on exp. as such fixed income markets have been particularly muted, with bunds lower by a modest 10 ticks. gilts slipped on the latest services pmis, with the stellar reading seeing the june'17 futures slips below yesterday's 128.22 nadir with bears now eyeing a potential test of a minor fib retracement level at 127.91. top european news in currencies, the bloomberg dollar spot index was little changed after a two-day gain. the euro edged lower to $1.0668. the pound climbed 0.3 percent to $1.248, advancing for the first time in three days as u.k services grew faster than economists expected. the south african rand jumped as much as 1.1 percent before falling 1.1 percent. the big data release this morning was the uk services pmi number, which exceeded expectations to print 55.0. this went against the manufacturing and construction components as new orders were attracted by the weak exchange rate, but despite this, thin market conditions have made for a tight range in cable, as support ahead of 1.2400 has been tempered by sellers coming in ahead of 1.2500. similarly in eur/gbp, .8545-50 and 0.8600 limits contain. range bound markets further highlighted by a 25 tick range in eur/usd, where a test of 1.0700 on the upside was rebuffed. the usd perspective has been largely behind this, with us treasury yields grinding higher, but to a modest degree as yet. this has produced a tentative move higher in usd/jpy, but we continue to trade south of the 111.00 level, but we have now twice survived a test on 110.00. a modest recovery in copper has given aud some relief after yesterday's selling across the board. no real change in sentiment at the rba, citing concerns over domestic debt levels but cautiously optimistic on the global outlook, so yield plays will carry favour here when the risk mood is calm. the same goes for the nzd, but we are getting pulled further away from 0.7000, but 0.6900 will be hard fought. in commodities , the bloomberg commodities index rose to a one-month high, buoyed by oil and base metals. west texas intermediate crude climbed 1.2 percent to $51.64 a barrel, adding to tuesday’s advance. base metals increased after a plan to develop an economic zone near beijing boosted the outlook for demand, with zinc climbing 1.8 percent as a smelter in peru was also affected by flooding. with oil tipping above the $51.50 mark, we could see some renewed consolidation inside these limits, but traders will be looking ever closely to the inventory data for signs of further impact from the production cuts. the market is still hoping for an extension to the agreement, and this hope reflects some of the recent gains seen. base metals are up right across the board, with copper up another 1.5% today, but outpaced by nickel which is up near 2.0% so far. gold has come back off the highs, where $1260 looks to be providing some clear resistance. silver continues to stall ahead of the usd18.40-50 area, with usd resilience weighing on both. looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe the main focus should be on the final march services and composite pmi revisions where we’ll also get a look at the data for the uk and periphery. this afternoon in the us we will also get the final pmi revisions along with the ism non-manufacturing for march (expected to decline to 57.0 from 57.6) and the adp employment change print for march. the consensus for the latter is 185k while our us economists are forecasting a below market 140k. later this evening we will also get the aforementioned fomc minutes from the march 15th meeting. away from that there is no fedspeak today although over at the boe policy maker vlieghe is due to speak this afternoon in london. us event calendar db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap we’re kicking off in france this morning where last night we had the second of three live televised presidential debates. much like the first it tested viewers’ stamina again with the clock running close to 4 hours in the end. in terms of the key takeaways the general feeling was that it was the six less popular candidates which largely stole the show, frequently questioning and attacking the front runners. of the candidates in contention, macron was largely on the defensive for most of the night, standing his ground but never seemingly coming under too much pressure. melenchon was the most attacking. fillon failed to really standout and took on a barrage of attacks on ethics and hamon was largely in the shadows. le pen was heavily questioned at times and looked under pressure and very much in defence first mode. le pen’s comments were also typically defiant and she closed out by making remarks including to “take back our sovereignty”, “civilisation in danger” and also “the owners of their country with the right to a border”. in terms of the early results an elabe poll covering 1,024 viewers following the debate found that melenchon was seen as the most convincing with 25% of the votes followed in order by macron (21%), fillon (15%) and le pen (11%). a separate opinionway survey had melenchon, macron and fillon all tied on 18% a piece followed by le pen with 11%. so that result would suggest that the debate has done little to further le pen’s chances with the elabe pollster highlighting that the fierce competition on the anti-european issues contributed to le pen’s mediocre score. as we said following the first debate though, hilary clinton was seen as the comfortable winner in all the us presidential debates so it’s worth taking these results in context. interestingly leading into the debate yesterday the 2y oat-bund spread hit a near 5-year high at 47bps, surpassing the high from earlier the year in february when the spread hit 42bps. to be fair this  might be as much to do with the supply and demand issues for bunds as anything else. the ecb isn't helping as we'll see below. price action in and around the debate hasn’t been particularly material however and if anything the euro is firmer and is in fact up about +0.40% from yesterday’s intraday low. we’ll wait to see if there is much of a reaction in markets in europe when they open this morning but the focus in the asia session has for the most part turned over to the news of another missile launch by north korea into the sea of japan. this has been confirmed by the pentagon and as a reminder comes just before president trump is due to host china’s president xi jinping tomorrow. that news hasn’t failed to stem what has been a mostly positive start to trading led by the reopening of bourses in china where the csi 300 and shanghai comp are both up over 1%. the hang seng is also +0.29% while the nikkei is +0.27%. the kospi and asx are currently flat, as are us equity futures. the moves in asia this morning follow a fairly directionless session on wall street last night. the s&p 500 passed between gains and losses 28 times during the day before finishing with a modest +0.06% gain. while banks underperformed (-0.34%) they did recover from heavier losses at the open helped by some comments from president trump around dodd-frank, and on separate reports on tax talks. the president confirmed that his administration is working on changes to the dodd-frank act which is intended to make it easier for banks to lend and which will include a “very major haircut”. on the tax front  the debate was about an article in the washington post which suggested that the trump administration is exploring a vat and carbon tax as part of the tax code overhaul, although this has been somewhat downplayed by a white house spokesman since. meanwhile energy stocks had a decent session after energy prices crept higher. despite no data or newsflow, wti oil (+1.57%) rose for the fifth time in the last six sessions to close above $51/bbl for the first time since march 7th. natural gas (+5.27%) also had its strongest day in almost three months and closed at the highest since january 27th. it’s worth noting that us hy energy spreads have now hit the tightest (446bps) since march 8th and are about 40bps tighter relative to the wides of the year made just last week. elsewhere, treasuries did their best to reverse much of monday’s rally with the 10y yield rising +4.1bps to close at 2.361%. it’s hovering around similar levels this morning. instead of the usual focus on deciphering fedspeak the focus was instead on the resignation of the richmond fed’s jeffrey lacker with immediate effect following the news that he had disclosed confidential information in an analyst meeting. lacker was due to retire later this year and while the news should have no real monetary policy impact (he was a non-voter) one would expect the fed chair to be questioned about the issue. while we’re on the fed today we will get the fomc minutes from last month’s meeting where it’ll be interesting to see how much of a debate around tapering of the balance sheet there was given all the recent forward guidance. the most significant news yesterday for credit was the latest ecb cspp data which was released a day later than usual yesterday and incorporated the data up to month end and was the last release before we see the first impact of tapering. last week they bought an average of €335mn corporates per day which was up from the prior week's non-holiday period low (€308mn) but below the daily average of €365mn since the program started. so a continuation in the slowdown in the run-up to qe tapering. we'll see next week if there is more trimming as the overall buying program officially reduces. one could argue credit easing via cspp makes more sense than pspp, given scarcity issues in government bonds, and so they could decide to continue cspp at the usual pace even as the broader qe gets trimmed. on the other hand, making the qe cut fall squarely on govies might send the wrong signal to the periphery/semi-core. there are no clues at the moment as to how they split the taper other than perhaps the hint of a slowdown in corporate purchases in the last two weeks. my personal view is that they do taper cspp as well as pspp. related to this we learnt that the average maturity of german bund purchases (the benchmark for euro credit) remained at very low levels (4.72 vs. 4.34 last month) in march. in december and january this was over 12 and 9 respectively. this matters for credit as if the ecb buying is concentrated at this maturity bucket it's more competing with the average life of the credit index and as such makes it more difficult for credit to keep up with the performance of bunds in what is essentially a risk on environment. for more on this see our credit bite ( https://goo.gl/ddv05y ) we published last month after the initial shock shortening of average life of bund purchases. the rest of the macro data did little to really move the dial. in the us, the february trade balance revealed a deficit of $43.6bn which was a little narrower than the consensus had expected and also $4.6bn narrower than the january deficit. meanwhile factory orders were reported as rising +1.0% mom in february which was in line with expectations and so putting them up +7.3% yoy. durable goods orders in february were revised up one-tenth at the final count to +1.8% mom however core capex orders were confirmed as declining -0.1% mom. in europe the only data concerned the retail sales numbers for february which printed at +0.7% mom for the euro area and more than expected. looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe the main focus should be on the final march services and composite pmi revisions where we’ll also get a look at the data for the uk and periphery. this afternoon in the us we will also get the final pmi revisions along with the ism non-manufacturing for march (expected to decline to 57.0 from 57.6) and the adp employment change print for march. the consensus for the latter is 185k while our us economists are forecasting a below market 140k. later

4025,Richmond Fed President Lacker Resigns After Admitting He Leaked Confidential Fed Information,2017-04-04 22:10:00+00:00,"we can now close the case on who leaked that confidential, market-moving data to medley global back in 2012: it was richmond fed's jeffrey lacker, who previously was expected to retire in october, and  is resigning immediately. in a statement, lacker confirms he revealed confidential fomc information to medley global and that he lied to the fed's general counsel on at least two occasions. his full statement is below: statement of dr. jeffrey lacker during the past 13 years it has been my privilege to serve as president of the federal reserve bank of richmond. it has also been an honor to contribute to the development of our nation's monetary policy as a member of the federal reserve's federal open market committee (""fomc""). while transparency of the monetary policy process is important, equally important are the confidentiality policies that protect the internal deliberations of the fomc and ensure the integrity of our financial markets. the federal reserve's confidentiality policies seek to guide participants in maintaining the balance between transparency and confidentiality. the fomc has had in place for many years two specific policies relating to confidentiality. the fomc policy on external communications of committee participants (the ""external communications policy-) and the program for security of fomc information (the ""information security policy""). in 2012, my conduct was inconsistent with those important confidentiality policies. specifically, on october 2, 2012, i spoke by phone with an analyst (""the analyst"") concerning the september 2012 meeting of the fomc. the analyst authors reports on federal reserve matters on behalf of medley global advisors (""medley'). medley publishes macro-economic policy intelligence for institutions such as hedge funds and asset managers and is owned by the financial times limited. during that october 2, 2012 discussion, the analyst introduced into the conversation an important non-public detail about one of the policy options considered by participants prior to the meeting. due to the highly confidential and sensitive nature of this information, i should have declined to comment and perhaps have ended the phone call. instead, i did not refuse or express my inability to comment and the interview continued . additionally, after that phone call i did not, as required by the information security policy, report to any fomc personnel that the analyst was in possession of confidential fomc information. when medley published a report by the analyst the following day, october 3, 2012, it contained this important detail about one of the policy options and i realized that my failure to decline comment on the information could have been taken by the analyst, in the context of the conversation, as an acknowledgment or confirmation of the information. i deeply regret the role i may have played in confirming this confidential information and in its dissemination to medley's subscribers. in this episode, as in all of my communications with analysts, journalists and the public, it was never my intention to reveal confidential information . i further acknowledge that through this and other conversations with the analyst, i may have contravened the external communications policy, which prohibits providing any profit-making person or organization with a prestige advantage over its competitors. following these events, i was interviewed on december 10, 2012, as part of an internal review conducted by the general counsel of the fomc. in advance of that interview, on december 6, 2012, i provided written responses to a questionnaire issued by the general counsel seeking, among other things, all relevant information regarding my communications with the analyst. althoug it was my intention to cooperate fully with the internal review, i regret that i did not disclose to the general counsel, either in my december 6, 2012 questionnaire or the december 10, 2012 interview, that the analyst was in possession of confidential information during my conversation with her on october 2,2012. in 2015, i was interviewed again as part of a separate investigation conducted by the united states attorney's office for the southern district of new york, the office of the inspector general of the federal reserve board, the federal bureau of investigation, and the u.s. commodity futures trading commission. in this subsequent 2015 interview with law enforcement officials, i did disclose that the analyst was in possession of confidential information during my october 2. 2012 conversation with her. i apologize to my colleagues and to the public i have been privileged to serve . i have always strived to maintain the appropriate balance between transparency and confidentiality, but i regret that in this instance i crossed the line to confirming information that should have remained confidential. i previously announced my intention to retire as president of the federal reserve bank of richmond in october 2017, and in light of these matters i have decided to make my departure from the federal reserve effective today. the richmond fed made the following announcement moments ago, which suggests that lacker did not leave voluntarily: the federal reserve places a high priority on safeguarding information. we expect every employee to comply with all relevant policies and procedures, as well as our standards of conduct. employees must review and acknowledge our policies annually. once our bank’s board of directors learned of the outcome of the government investigations, they took appropriate actions . we are focused on moving forward within our organization—and were already underway with our presidential search, following jeffrey lacker’s announcement in january to retire in 2017. this search process will continue as scheduled. in the interim, first vice president mark mullinix is serving as the bank’s acting president. this shocking event comes just hours after chairman of the house financial services committee jeb hensarling demanded that ""american households should demand a more reliable governance structure for the fed."" as cnbc's steve liesman adds, lacker's resignation was the result of negotiations with law enforcement officials. while that does not make it clear if lacker will now not face criminal prosecution for leaking material information - recall the fbi has been probing the fed's 2012 leak to medley since 2015 - this is great news for janet yellen, who was personally close with medley's regina schleiger, ther person at the center of the fed leak scandal, as the fed chair is now off the hook. or maybe not: while lacker has taken blame for the medley leak from october 3, 2012, recall that the fed was also investigating a second leak, involving a september 28, 2012 article in the wsj by jon hilsenrath titled "" how bernanke pulled the fed his way"" in which bernanke's planning to launch qe3 was described in great detail. as the fed revealed in a foia seeking information on the internal probes, the wsj leak is ongoing: one article was published in the wall street journal (wsj) on september 28, 2012, and appeared to disclose information about discussions of committee participants around the june, august and september, 2012, fomc meetings in apparent violation of the fomc’s policies regarding security of fomc information. in particular, this first article included: as for who will replace lacker, trump will surely have some thoughts on that, as lacker's seat becomes a voting one in 2018. * * * update: no charges will be brought against lacker. statement from lacker's attorney, richard cullen of mcguire woods: pic.twitter.com/r0uk028zba — binyamin appelbaum (@bcappelbaum) april 4, 2017 no further comment, although maybe ben bernanke can blog about it one

4030,The Fed Has Shifted (And The Market Missed It),2017-04-04 21:21:00+00:00,"authored by kevin muir via the macro tourist blog, the fed has a new message. so far the market is not listening, but it should be, as the shift will have a profound effect on financial markets. it started with the dissent at the last fomc meeting from neel kashkari. in an unusual move, kashkari published a blog piece explaining his dissent. although he presented plenty of the usual reasons for not going along with the hike (mostly centered around the whole idea of the 2% inflation being a target, not a ceiling), kashkari introduced the idea the fed should be thinking about unwinding its balance sheet. proving that stopped clocks are right twice a day, i have written about the possibility the fed would shift their tightening bias through traditional fed funds raises, to balance sheet wind down - (the end of calm bond markets) . continuing to raise rates while maintaining the large balance sheet could create a negative cash flow situation for the federal reserve. given this worry, it makes no sense for them to tighten policy through rates when they can accomplish the same thing through the unwinding of their balance sheet. it looks as if the fed has taken this idea to heart. from business insider: today it was new york fed president william dudley’s job to hammer home the message. he’s one of the most influential members on the policy-setting federal open market committee. his new york fed deals with the securities that are on the fed’s balance sheet as a result of qe. and he said the fed might start reversing qe this year. with this call to shrink the fed’s balance sheet, he is following in the footsteps of other fed heads, including cleveland fed president loretta mester, san francisco fed president john williams, and most notably boston fed president eric rosengren – a former “dove” who has been publicly fretting about bubbles in commercial real estate and housing and the risks they pose to “financial stability.” so this theme unraveling qe, not in the foggy future but this year, is picking up momentum. i disagree with business insider that the theme is picking up momentum. the fed is bashing the message over our heads with a stick. that’s not momentum, that’s a pedal to the metal press. the federal reserve is signaling that although they are not retracting the guidance for 3 hikes this year (meaning two more as we have already done one), any further tightening will be done from the unwinding of the fed’s balance sheet. we had qe. now we are going to have reverse qe. from business insider again - quoting ny fed president bill dudley: “it wouldn’t surprise me if sometime later this year or sometime in 2018, should the economy perform in line with our expectations, that we’ll start to gradually let securities mature rather than reinvesting them.” “if we start to normalize the balance sheet, that’s a substitute for short-term rate hikes because it would also work in the direction of tightening financial conditions.” “if and when we decide to begin to normalize the balance sheet we might actually decide at the same time to take a little pause in terms of raising short-term interest rates.” bam! there it is. the fed will stop raising rates, and will instead start using the balance sheet to tighten policy. i can’t say i disagree with anything good old bill has said so far, but then he trotted out this gem: and he is “not that worried that the markets are going to react to the changes in our balance sheet in a violent way because it’s already factored in.” bullshit. this policy is not factored in at all. not even close. this whole fed communication push is the first attempt to have the market understand the policy shift. so what does it mean? and more importantly, how do we profit from it? let’s start with the obvious trade. if the federal reserve shifts from tightening monetary policy through fed funds rate hikes to balance sheet wind down, short rates will not rise as much as would otherwise be the case. at its extreme, the federal reserve would also be selling long dated securities. all of this adds up to a steeper yield curve. since yellen has taken over as fed chairperson, the yield curve has been continually flattening as she has steadily withdrawn monetary accommodation. market participants are convinced the fed will continue with this policy for some time to come. speculators have never been more short 3 month eurodollar futures contracts. these contracts are not foreign exchange contracts and have nothing to do with the european currency, but instead represent the best way to hedge us dollar short term rates. so let me get this straight. speculators are betting heavily on higher us short term rates, meanwhile, the federal reserve is signaling they might slow down rate hikes and replace it with balance sheet reduction? there are many different ways to play this potentail unwind, but i certainly wouldn’t want to be short any us dollar fixed income instrument shorter than five years. yet yield curve shifts aren’t the only opportunities offered up from the fed’s policy change. the federal reserve owns $2.4 trillion of us treasuries and $1.8 trillion in mortgage backed bonds. if i were a member of the fomc board, i would push to wind down the mortgage back bonds first, but even if they choose a pro-rata wind down, the fed will no longer be purchasing a large amount of mortgage backed securities that they were previously rolling. mortgage backed securities are different from us treasuries. as rates decline, more homeowners refinance, so the mortgage instrument’s duration declines - right when you want the opposite to happen. when rates rise, fewer homeowners refinance, so the duration extends - again, right at the worse time. mortgages are therefore negative volatility securities. when the fed was buying mortgages, they were removing volatility from the bond market. conversely, when they sell, they would be demanding volatility. this is a good argument for owning fixed income volatility, but there is another aspect to the fed’s change that might present an even better opportunity. ben melkman from light sky macro was recently interviewed on realvision tv. there have been some really smart people on realvision, but i think ben might be at the top of my list. instead of trying to rehash his point, here is his argument from that interview: “the fed has been a whole flow of mortgages for many years. and when the fed buys mortgages, they don’t hedge any of the extension duration characteristics of mortgages… if the fed stops buying mortgages, the private sector will have to start buying those mortgages, just as yields are going higher (ie: away from the average coupon). as you do that, those mortgages extend pretty quickly in duration. in that environment, those private sector holders have to hedge that duration extension risk by paying swap. so not only is the fed making the private sector buy more duration as the mortgages extend that increases rapidly, and so i think two things happen. the curve sells off and steepens, and this becomes a good catalyst for what has been a very distorted swap spread curve (usually swaps trade at a lower yield than bonds, libor risk should trade at a higher risk than government risk.)” i have spoken about the strange anomalies in the swap market before - “how many other could never happens are out there?” . heck, i even chronicled how, like an idiot, i was buying the swap spread “only for the bravest and stupidest” back then i didn’t have a reason to bet on a return to normalcy except that negative swap spreads were dumb. but now i have a catalyst. the fed’s shift in policy should cause the previously negative swap spreads to expand back to more normal levels. not only that, but there is another tailwind that melkman did not mention. theoretically swap spreads should never go negative. the counter party risk of the bank on the other side of the swap is higher than the risk free us treasuries. it makes no sense for swaps to trade lower than treasuries. yet they did. although no one knows with certainty the reasons, the lack of bank balance sheet availability was definitely a contributing factor. after the great credit crisis 2008, as regulations tightened, banks were less willing to extend credit for swap trades. therefore demand for swaps outpaced supply, pushing the yield below treasuries. with trump’s victory, it is safe to say that regulation is only headed one way. banks are already opening up their balance sheets. and when combined with the recent rate rises, swaps have finally started to trade at levels more appropriate. us 5 year swap spreads have even gone from negative to positive levels once again. that means the us 5 year swap rate is above the 5 year treasury yield. professor malkiel can once again put that portion of the swap curve back into his lesson plan of efficient markets. farther out the curve, swap spreads are doing their best, but have not yet crossed out of “illogical” levels. but, at the long end of the curve, the streams are still crossed . putting it all together, with the fed signaling a move away from rate hikes as their preferred method of removing accommodation towards letting their balance sheet wind down, this should mean a steeper yield curve with widening swap spreads. buying the 5/30 steepener, but instead of shorting 30 year treasuries, replacing it with short 30 year swaps, means you can pick up an extra 40 basis points (for us hacks that don’t have isda’s, there is a swap future you can trade. see my previous post about swaps to learn how to hedge it properly .) the fed is communicating a big shift in policy. so far the market has not responded, but that just means there is more opportunity for those who understand how to profit from it. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",LIBOR Commercial Real Estate San Francisco Fed Credit Crisis Neel Kashkari William Dudley New York Fed Federal Reserve Yield Curve Volatility 5 Year Treasury Monetary Policy Bill Dudley EuroDollar Bond fixed Mortgage Backed Securities Cleveland Fed Real estate John Williams,1
4092,Why Are Stocks Unhappy: RBC Looks Below The Surface Of Today's Selling,2017-04-03 18:58:00+00:00,"after a stellar quarter for us equities, stocks have unexpectedly slumped on the first day of q2 despite ""whispers"" of pent upmutual fund reallocation into risk assets that would take place today. so why are stocks lower,  besides ""more sellers than buyers"" and ""money going back to the sidelines"" of course? for a comprehensive assessment of what is going on below the surface, here is rbc's charlie mcelligott (who as a reminder warned on friday about the double whammy in the april effect ) looking today's rates reversal, the shift to ""anti-beta"" leadership and the ""momentum factor"" reversal, all of which explain the bad start to the second quarter. rates reversal, 'anti-beta' leadership and 'momentum factor' reversal within equities not good start to q2 summary details - historically, this first week of april has been a positive one for risk-assets / higher usd and higher us rates.  why?  it might have something to do with the start of the japanese fiscal new year.  into year-end, yen repatriation flows drive higher yen / weaker nikkei, lower usd and us rates.  in theory, the commencement of the new fiscal year in japan reverses that flow, and thus, the pivot to weaker yen / higher usd / higher nikkei and higher us rates. so, we now have this additional short-term driver contributing to usd strength, which is proving to ‘hurt’ those who had recently flipped-short per what had been the nascent ‘policy convergence’ narrative.  the issue of course was that last week (as we predicted the day post-fed) fomc members--especially doves--rolled out ‘hawkish’….while late last week, a number of ecb speakers (nowotny, praet and knot) were seemingly forced to walk the ‘dovish’ plank.  so, just as euro longs were being built by tactical funds and shorts slashed / covered (cftc speculative positioning least net short since may 2014), we saw the eurusd drop from 1.0906 highs last week to its current 1.0665 level….ouch. - so for now, the near-term narrative has shifted back to the “central bank policy divergence” story as the ‘chief usd-driver.’  that said, this week’s very heavy us econ data calendar will have a role to play too with usd and with us rates as well, especially with the profoundly ‘cleaner’ rates positioning of late, following the enormous leveraged-fund ust short-cover spree of the past few weeks against the ‘lumpy’ asset-manager long selling seen in 5y and 10y. where we are not seeing less-extreme positioning is the front-end, as the spec net positioning in 3m eurodollars goes even deeper to another new record net short: the above positioning seemingly speaks to confidence on more hikes coming down the pipe from the leveraged fund universe.  however, as my colleague mark orsley points out this a.m., there have to be some hedgies sweating their ed$ shorts a bit following 1) fed’s dudley dovish interview with bloomberg over weekend…while at the same time, we’re 2) seemingly catching-hints of the long-awaited “true up” between hard vs soft data divergence as expressed by indicators such as the atlanta fed gdpnow gdp forecast (hard-data focused) turn markedly lower, while numerous street economists reduced q1 gdp numbers (rbc from 2.5% to 2.0%); mark also speaks to 3) strong ed$ april seasonality as well and 4) bullish ‘inverse head and shoulders’ in edz8 and a bear-flattening ‘head and shoulder’ in edz7 / edz8 curve. - the markit us manu pmi released earlier touches on this “soft versus hard” data dynamic—here are the comments from chief business economist at his markit chris williamson speaking to the thought i’ve been pushing on the likelihood of the ‘soft’ survey beats likely to ‘mean-revert’ down to hard data: “the post-election resurgence of the manufacturing sector seen late last year is showing signs of losing steam. output growth slowed to a six-month low in march, optimism about the outlook has waned and hiring has slowed accordingly. while the survey data suggest that the goods producing sector enjoyed a relatively good first quarter on the whole, the loss of momentum seen in february and march bodes ill for the second quarter.” ‘soft’ beats z-score sees downtick following this morning’s u.s. data dump: us stocks today all about watching for sub-index level signs of ‘april effect’ commencement (as per friday afternoon’s “big picture” note). there will be certain buy-side ‘performance pain’ if the market was to see a perpetuation of the ‘recent’ april ‘momentum-unwind’ phenomenon , largely on account of 1) ‘crowded longs’ (and thus with significant ‘momentum’ attributes) being so heavily ‘growth’-weighted (tech, biotech, cons disc) and 2) significant ‘market’ factor crowding risk in long portfolios, i.e. longs are exceedingly ‘high beta’ right now (‘high growth’ basket raw beta to spx = 1.25, adjusted beta 1.16; ‘s&p info tech’ sector raw beta to spx = 1.20, adjusted beta to spx = 1.14; ‘high hedge fund concentration’ basket raw beta to spx = 1.19, adjusted beta to spx = 1.13). today as noted in the summary above sees ‘duration sensitive’ sectors like ‘defensives’ / ‘low vol’ / ‘anti-beta’ as the clear outperformers, with the ‘new’ safe-haven of ‘secular growers’ like tech holding modestly well initially, but fading currently. also from a risk sentiment perspective, it’s notable that the bounce seen last week in ‘reflation’ plays i.e. ‘cyclical beta’ and ‘value,’ which in light of seeing gdp #’s taken lower around the street currently likely shows further pain to come with rates rallying. so, ‘growth’ poster-child ‘tech’ is now slipping lower, and as such, so too are ‘momentum longs’ fading.  in conjunction ‘anti-beta’ outperform against a buy-side universe so ‘long beta’ (‘market’) isn’t a great indicator for the start of q2, especially with ‘reflation’ / ‘value’ being hit. model equity l/s portfolio sucking wind here with ‘wrong leadership’ from ‘defensives’ against ‘growth’ longs—and thus, ‘momentum’--fading: tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Japan Markit Yen Nikkei,1

in potential contrast to the march fomc dovish reaction to the lower than expected fed dots path.  the ecb also releases its march meeting minutes where the market will try to get more insight over the precise points of dispute between hawks and doves concerning monetary policy tightening and the sequencing of instruments. given the re-pricing of forwards following hike expectations pushback over the last week and the permanence of 5y premia pricing, there is limited scope for a drop in front-end rates. emerging markets there will be monetary policy meetings in india, israel, peru, poland and romania. rating reviews in belarus, czech republic, morocco, romania, saudi arabia and south africa. summary of key weekly data visually, courtesy of bofa: from db's jim reid, here is a breakdown of key daily events: this morning we’re kicking off the week in europe with the final manufacturing pmi’s for march as well as a first look at the data for the uk and periphery. also due out is ppi and unemployment rate data for the euro area. this afternoon in the us we’ll get the final manufacturing and composite pmi’s for march along with the ism manufacturing print and february construction spending data. later this evening we’ll also get the march vehicle sales data. during the asia session tomorrow we’ll have the rba meeting outcome where no change is expected. in europe we’ve got retail sales data for the euro area due while in the us we will get the final durable and capital goods orders data revisions for february, along with february’s trade balance reading and factory orders data. wednesday looks set to be a busy data with the final march services and composite pmi’s due in japan and then in europe. we’ll also get the final services pmi in the us along with the adp employment report for march and ism non-manufacturing print. also due out will be the march fomc meeting minutes. turning to thursday, the early data is due out of china with the caixin pmi’s. in germany we’ll get factory orders data while the ecb meeting minutes will also be released around lunchtime. in the us on thursday the calendar is quiet with just initial jobless claims data due. it looks set to be a busy end to the week on friday. in europe we are due to get industrial production reports and trade data for the uk, france and germany. in the us all eyes will be on the march employment report including the all important payrolls print. wholesale inventories and consumer credit will also be due out in the us. away from the data the fedspeakers this week include dudley, harker and lacker today followed by tarullo on tuesday and williams on thursday. the ecb’s coeure speaks today. away from that, the second french presidential debate is due tomorrow night. as with the first debate it will be televised live. president trump is also due to host china president xi jinping on thursday and friday. an informal eu finance ministers meeting is also due on friday and saturday. * * * finally, a summary of all key us events with consensus expectations and highlights from goldman monday, april 3 tuesday, april 4 wednesday, april 5 thursday, april 6 friday, april 7 source: bofa, db, gs tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",China San Francisco Fed Dallas Fed Germany Initial Jobless Claims Japan March FOMC Markit William Dudley New York Fed Federal Reserve Financial Regulation Trade Deficit Daniel Tarullo Consumer Credit Romania Poland Czech Philly Fed Trade Balance Monetary Policy Richmond Fed Consumer Confidence Wholesale Inventories Continuing Claims Chicago PMI India Unemployment Israel Saudi Arabia Real Interest Rates Jim Reid John Williams Eurozone France,1

after data showed inflation in the currency bloc had slowed by more than expected in march. government bond yields in the euro zone's lower-rated countries meanwhile rose on monday, underperforming their peers as a reduction in the european central bank's bond purchase program took effect. as of the start of april, the ecb's monthly asset purchases fell to 60 billion euros from 80 billion euros.

asia equity markets start the quarter on a mostly positive note, although gains were relatively reserved as the region digested a slew of mixed data releases. nikkei 225 (+0.4%) gained following the boj's tankan survey which despite missing expectations for large manufacturers index and outlook, still showed an improvement from prior while large all-industry capex unexpectedly expanded and the small manufacturing index rose to its highest in nearly a decade. asx 200 (-0.2%) traded subdued as commodity related sectors underperformed with an unexpected contraction in retail sales also dampening sentiment, while hang seng (+0.5%) also edged gains despite chinese caixin manufacturing pmi falling short of estimates, as the data still showed the 9th consecutive monthly expansion and is solely focused on the mainland which was closed for tomb sweeping day. 10yr jgbs traded lower amid gains seen in japanese stocks and after today's boj rinban announcement was for a relatively paltry jpy 370b1n. furthermore, the curve flattened amid underperformance in the short-end. key asian economic data top asian news in europe, the new quarter has kicked off in a tentative fashion, with major indices relatively unmoved so far this morning. in terms of a sector breakdown, financials are the laggards this session as energy names outperform, with little of note on a stock specific basis to report. with newsflow light elsewhere, linde are among the best performers in frankfurt this morning, trading higher by (+1.4%) after the co.'s chairman and ceo reiterated their confidence that the praxair deal will be completed in the near future. elsewhere, fixed income markets have seen upside in bunds so far this morning, with the curve slightly steeper and all major counterparts wider against the german 10y. the auction calendar is relatively bare today as the week kicks off, however is set to pick up later in the week as supply is scheduled from the likes of uk, germany, france and spain. top european news in currencies, britain’s pound fell as much as 0.5 percent to $1.2492 after the worse-than-expected manufacturing data. south africa’s rand tumbled 1.2 percent against the dollar, the most among major global currencies. the euro was little changed at $1.0655 and the bloomberg dollar index climbed 0.2 percent. fx markets have traded in a fairly tight range so far this session, with the only notable news coming in the form of the latest manufacturing pmis, national readings from across the eurozone printed a relatively mixed picture, with the eurozone figure itself coming in line with expected, to see eur/usd unchanged on the day. elsewhere, the uk saw manufacturing pmi print a 4 month low and gbp/usd move below 1.2500 as a consequence. the latest pmi readings from the uk will do little to support the latest 'trade of the week's from the likes of morgan stanley and barclays, who both recommend selling eur/gbp. in commodities, wti crude was little-changed at $50.62 a barrel, after the biggest weekly gain of the year. crude stockpiles are starting to decline in a sign that the production cuts implemented this year are bringing the market to balance, according to opec’s secretary-general mohammad barkindo. gold fell 0.3 percent to $1,245.70 per ounce. the metal has alternated between gains and losses for the past six days. trade has been choppy so

steady. us event calendar central banks db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap welcome to a new financial quarter. one surprising element of q1 was that the vix index had its lowest average quarter since q4 2006. as we've discussed a lot recently it seems that data best predicts where equity vol will trade but we've been surprised that there hasn't been the odd spike up given the political uncertainties on both sides of the atlantic. data is winning out for now. on this, today see the release of the global pmis which have been key to the decent performance (and low vol) of equities in q1. tomorrow we'll likely update our pmi/yoy equity (%) performance charts but so far the rally in q1 is consistent with the data so this is a key monthly number. the rest of the week ahead is at the end before the performance review but after today's data deluge the week is bookended by mr trump hosting china president xi jinping (thursday/friday) and friday's payrolls which to be honest doesn't feel quite as important as it often can do. with employment consistently firm of late, inflation numbers seem to have taken over as the swing factor for the pace of fed hikes and on this side of the pond, further tapering from the ecb. on the ecb, today marks the start of the eu80 to eu60 billion taper (our words not draghi's!) and while we don't know the taper split between pspp and cspp, this is going to be an interesting development to watch. first signs will occur next monday where the weekly release will contain 3 days under the new regime. last week's cspp number showed the lowest number outside of holiday periods so it'll be interesting to see this afternoon's release to see whether last week was a one-off or the start of slowly adjusting to a new lower level of corporate bond purchases. before we get there, the weekend newsflow has been fairly light although we have opened with some trump-related headlines to decipher. specifically it’s an interview that the president had with the ft which is attracting the most attention in it, the president was quoted as saying that the us is willing to take unilateral action against north korea should it need to, regardless of china’s position. his exact quote was “if china is not going to solve north korea, we will”. the subject of north korea is set to be a big talking point between trump and president xi later this week so it’ll be worth keeping an eye on that. the other significant news from this weekend comes from china. first is the announcement out of the pboc on saturday in which the bank raised the interest rate for overnight standing lending facility loans by 20bps to 3.3%. at the same time the bank also raised the rate of 7-day loans to 3.45% and the 1-month rate to 3.8%. this follows similar mini hikes earlier in the year. the pboc also said that it will “continue to implement a sound and neutral monetary policy, striking a good balance among maintaining growth and containing bubbles and mitigating risks”. staying with china, there was a little bit of disappointment in the weekend data with the caixin manufacturing pmi coming in 0.5pts lower in march at 51.2 (vs. 51.7 expected). that contrasts with the improvement in the official manufacturing pmi we saw on friday to 51.8 (from 51.6). markets are closed in china this morning however bourses elsewhere have mostly kicked off april and q2 on the front foot. in japan the nikkei and topix are +0.38% and +0.31% respectively following the release of the boj’s tankan survey which showed some moderate improvement in business conditions for both small and large manufacturing businesses in q1. elsewhere the hang seng is +0.45% and kospi +0.28%, while the asx is -0.14% following some mixed data in australia this morning. us equity index futures have opened with small gains while commodities are largely unchanged. quickly recapping friday’s session now. while markets in europe generally recovered from early losses, it was a bit of a directionless session in the us with equity markets in the end slightly underperforming. moves were fairly modest though with the stoxx 600 closing +0.18% and the s&p 500 -0.23%, with the latter paring the weekly move to +0.80%. in sovereign bond markets 10y treasury yields generally tracked lower as the session went on and finished -3.2bps by the closing bell at 2.388%. that closing level also nicely bisected what was a fairly tight 8bps trading range over the full course of the week. the fed’s dudley probably disappointed some of the hawks by saying that the economy is clearly not overheating and that the rise in sentiment is not showing up in hard data. he also said that a couple more hikes this year “seems reasonable” but that also that the fed may look to shrink the balance sheet later this year or in 2018, in which case they “might actually decide at the same time to take a little pause in terms of raising short term interest rates”. meanwhile in europe 10y bund yields edged down 0.5bps to 0.322% with a disappointing euro area cpi report not helping matters (more on that shortly). elsewhere, in commodities wti oil (+0.50%) rose for the fourth session in a row and in doing so capped a weekly return of +5.48% which was the best since december with hopes rising that opec will extend its production cut deal past june. much of the focus on friday was on the vast amount of data released on both sides of the pond. in the us there was some disappointment in the february personal spending print which came in at just +0.1% mom (vs. +0.2% expected), with real spending also falling unexpectedly (-0.1% mom vs. +0.1% expected). personal income did however rise +0.4% mom as expected while the savings rate also rose to a five-month high. on the inflation front the pce deflator was confirmed as rising +0.1% mom in february and the core +0.2% mom which helped to hold the yoy rate at +1.8%. away from that, the chicago pmi beat expectations after coming in at 57.7 in march (from 57.4; 56.9 expected) while the university of michigan consumer sentiment reading was revised down at the final reading to 96.9 from 97.6, albeit still 0.2pts ahead of the february reading. all told the atlanta fed have now revised down their q1 gdp estimate to 0.9% from 1.0% however the ny fed’s measure continues to remain at a much higher 2.9%. our us economists sit in the middle and are forecasting +2.0% in q1. over in europe on friday the main disappointment was the aforementioned cpi report for the euro area in march where headline cpi was estimated to be +1.5% yoy and down from +2.0%. consensus was for +1.8% while the core rate also dipped to +0.7% yoy from +0.9%. that is the joint lowest core reading since april last year and you would imagine would give the ecb some food for thought. meanwhile, in the uk q4 gdp growth was confirmed at +0.7% qoq. in germany the unemployment rate dipped one-tenth to 5.8% in march while february retail sales came in at a much better than expected +1.8% mom (vs. +0.7% expected). to the week ahead now. this morning we’re kicking off the week in europe with the final manufacturing pmi’s for march as well as a first look at the data for the uk and periphery. also due out is ppi and unemployment rate data for the euro area. this afternoon in the us we’ll get the final manufacturing and composite pmi’s for march along with the ism manufacturing print and february construction spending data. later this evening we’ll also get the march vehicle sales data. during the asia session tomorrow we’ll have the rba meeting outcome where no change is expected. in europe we’ve got retail sales data for the euro area due while in the us we will get the final durable and capital goods orders data revisions for february, along with february’s trade balance reading and factory orders data. wednesday looks set to be a busy data with the final march services and composite pmi’s due in japan and then in europe. we’ll also get the final services pmi in the us along with the adp employment report for march and ism non-manufacturing print. also due out will be the march fomc meeting minutes. turning to thursday, the early data is due out of china with the caixin pmi’s. in germany we’ll get factory orders data while the ecb meeting minutes will also be released around lunchtime. in the us on thursday the calendar is quiet with just initial jobless claims data due. it looks set to be a busy end to the week on friday. in europe we are due to get industrial production reports and trade data for the uk, france and germany. in the us all eyes will be on the march employment report including the all important payrolls print. wholesale inventories and consumer credit will also be due out in the us. away from the data the fedspeakers this week include dudley, harker and lacker today followed by tarullo on tuesday and williams on thursday. the ecb’s coeure speaks today. away from that, the second french presidential debate is due tomorrow night. as with the first debate it will be televised live. president trump is also due to host china president xi jinping on thursday and friday. an informal eu finance ministers meeting is also due on friday and saturday. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com

4154,"Stockman Warns ""'Stimulus-Blinded' Mules Don't See What's Coming At All""",2017-04-02 02:03:00+00:00,"authored by david stockman via bonner & partners, reagan’s top economic adviser david stockman explains why trump’s tax cuts... and his stimulus plan... are dead on arrival. the mules of wall street were back at it again, buying the dips after the overnight whoosh downward in the futures market. apparently, it will take an actual two-by-four between the eyes to break a habit that has been working for 96 months now since the march 2009 post-crisis bottom. we think it is plain as day, however, that we are in a new ball game that the ""stimulus-blinded” mules don’t see coming at all. to wit, they have been juiced for eight years running by the keynesian apparatchiks at the fed who needed permission from exactly no one to run the printing presses full tilt or to rescue the market with a new round of qe or an extension of zirp whenever the indices began to wobble. but now, even the money printers have made it clear in no uncertain terms that they are done for this cycle, anyway, and that they will be belatedly but consistently raising interest rates for what ought to be a truly scary reason. that is, the denizens of the eccles building have finally realized that they have not outlawed the business cycle after all and need to raise rates toward 2-3% so that they have headroom to ""cut"" the next time the economy slides into the ditch. in effect, the fed is saying to wall street: ""price in"" a recession because we are! after all, our monetary central planners are not reluctantly allowing interest rates to lift off the zero bound because they have become converts to the cause of honest price discovery—-nor are they fixing to liberate money rates, debt yields, and the prices of stocks and other financial assets to clear on the free market. instead, they are merely storing up monetary ammo for the next downturn. but the wall street mules keep buying the dips anyway because they are under the preposterous delusion that one source of ""stimulus"" is just as good as the next. and since the gamblers have now decreed that the ""stimulus"" baton be handed off to fiscal policy, it only remains for congress and the white house to shape up and get the job done with all deliberate speed. but they won’t. not in a million years. the massive trump tax cut and infrastructure stimulus is doa because uncle sam is broke and the u.s. economy has slithered into moribund old age. in that context, it’s not remotely the same as the 12  members of the fomc sitting behind closed doors for two days jawing about the short-term economic weather; and then at the conclusion of their gabfest, ordering the new york fed’s open market desk to flood the canyons of wall street with cash by buying another $80 billion of bonds with digital credits conjured from thin air. au contraire. fiscal policy is inherently an exercise in herding cats and an especially impossible one when the cupboards are bare. the essence of the matter at the present state of play is the legislative equivalent of ""no ticky, no washy."" without a 10-year budget resolution for fy [fiscal year] 2018 and associated reconciliation instructions, there is no possibility of passing a tax bill or even an infrastructure spending boondoggle. but hammering out a budget resolution, passing it in each house, and reconciling the differences in conference would take months under the best of circumstances. but given the parlous state of uncle sam’s fiscal condition and the partisan acrimony that already suffuses washington in the era of trump, passage of a budget resolution by summer would be a miracle in itself. indeed, even the thought of surmounting this next daunting legislative obstacle course puts to rest this week’s particular wall street fantasy. namely that after being burned by the freedom caucus on obamacare lite, the trump white house will now ""pivot"" to the middle and form a coalition with the democrats to make a deal on corporate tax cuts and infrastructure spending. yes, and if dogs could whistle, the world would be a chorus. that is to say, there is no conceivable fiscal policy menu that could be agreed upon by speaker ryan, nancy pelosi, chuck schumer, and the donald, and then be shoe-horned into a 10-year budget resolution. yet without a budget resolution and reconciliation instructions, there is not a fiscal stimulus ""ticky"" and no grand bipartisan compromise on building airports and slashing corporate tax rates. so what lies directly ahead, therefore, is another bumbling attempt by the white house and congressional republicans to hammer out an fy 2018 budget resolution and what amounts to a 10-year fiscal plan. and it is there where the whole fantasy of the trump stimulus comes a cropper. there are not remotely 218 gop votes for what would be a $12 trillion-13 trillion add to the national debt with the trump stimulus program over the next decade—-even with all the ""dynamic"" scoring and revenue ""reflows"" that are imaginable. to be sure, this is why the gop congressional leadership stoutly insists on a deficit-neutral tax cut . they are keenly aware of the debt monster they have been kicking down the road—-even if the headline-reading robo-traders of wall street are not. what that means, in turn, of course, is that the rapidly fracturing trump/republican coalition must find the offsets on the spending side of the ledger. in short, the whole enterprise amounts to budgetary madness and demonstrates the monumental magnitude of the debt trap that has enveloped the imperial city. and the “buy the dip” crowd will soon be getting that two-by-four between the eyes. so now is not the time to buy. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",White House Nancy Pelosi New York Fed National Debt Recession Obamacare Futures market,1
4252,"Fed's Dudley: ""I Don’t Think We Are Removing The Punch Bowl Yet""",2017-03-30 22:06:00+00:00,"in case there was still any doubt as to what the ""data-dependent"" federal reserve reacts to, it was once again removed today when speaking in remarks at the university of south florida in sarasota , florida, ny fed president bill dudley said that ""it is important not to overreact to every short-term wiggle in financial markets ."" which confirms that the fed has traditionally overreacted to every short-term wiggle in financial markets, and which contradicts what both kocherlakota and what rosengren said previously, namely that the market is ""not a driving force"" for the fed's outlook. of course, we appreciate dudley's wry humor in stating that the fed should not unleash the bullard every time there is an even 5% s&p correction with threats of qe4, although with the elections now far in the past, we can see why the federal reserve would not mind a ""modest correction"" something both evans and rosengren warned yesterday could happen as the market is now clearly ""frothy ."" that said, don't assume the fed will allow a full blown crash: because as dudley also said in his speech,while the fed is "" not removing the punch bowl yet"" - his words - it is ""just adding a bit more fruit juice."" to wit: ""prior to the march fomc meeting, financial conditions were generally easing rather than becoming tighter, even as the fomc raised its policy rate in december and market participants increasingly expected further policy tightening in the coming year.  between the december and march fomc meetings, u.s. equity prices rose by about 4 percent, and credit spreads, such as those for high-yield bonds, narrowed.  long-term yields and the trade-weighted dollar were little changed over this period. william mcchesney martin, the ninth chair of the fomc, once famously opined that the federal reserve is “in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up .”  i don’t think we are removing the punch bowl, yet.  we’re just adding a bit more fruit juice. maybe not removing the punch bowl yet , but by stating clearly that it is being diluted, dudley confirmed what goldman said two weeks ago, when the bank warned that the market has misread the fed's recent hike, which was not dovish, but was meant to be a hawkish, if modest, tightening of financial conditions. * * * in addition to the above comments, dudley also said that tapering of the fed's balance-sheet reinvestments may be “a better course” than an earlier, abrupt end. among his other statements: tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",March FOMC Federal Reserve Florida Bill Dudley,1
4279,S&P Futures Fade Overnight Gains As Euro Slides; China Stumbles,2017-03-30 11:38:00+00:00,"asian shares and oil are lower, european shares are little changed, and s&p futures are fractionally in the red after gaining for most of the overnight session, perhaps troubled by warnings from two fed presidents who warned that markets and valuations appear frothy, and the federal reserve may have to raise rates more times than currently forecast. the latest round of fed hawkishness helped the dollar gain further after recent losses which earlier this week pushed it to 4 month lows. that said, overnight the usdjpy appeared to fade much of yesterday's gains, dipping back under 111 around the european open, only to see another unexplained jerk higher shortly before 6am eastern. summarizing some of yesterday's key macro events, socgen's kit juckes writes that ""the unnamed ecb source is back, telling reuters that markets had over-interpreted mario draghi's comments at the last meeting and that a further rise in bond yields would be problematic. cue lower bond yields, and a slightly weaker euro. if this morning's preliminary march german cpi data deliver the expected base—effect-induced slip from 2.2% to 1.6%, we can look forward to this trend going a little further. i'm not sure how far we can go in the absence of a return of political concerns however. the fx market doesn't have a significant euro long position that can be flushed out (it probably has a small euro short, instead). and i'm not convinced that interest rate expectations can go that far."" juckes was right, and the eurusd indeed slid further after a series of weak german regional cpis, which has seen continued pressure following yesterday's ecb rumors and hawkish fed commentary. european traders will now look at german prices which are expected to rise 1.8% from the year before after cpi accelerated 2.2% in february. the ecb’s dovish tone has once again established the diverging outlook between u.s. and european monetary policy, manifesting itself in some recent spread widening between german and us 10-year yields. juckes had some observations on this too, and said that ""in recent months, the us/german nominal yield differential has overtaken the real yield differential in terms of its correlation with eur/usd. both are better-correlated with the exchange rate than shorter-dated rates. the 10-year yield spread had narrowed from a wide position of 235bp in late december to as little as 196bp last week and is back above 200bp this morning . if the ecb is trying to anchor bond yields (and if they succeed in limiting how much they follow us moves), then the real driver of eur/usd for a while will be what happens to us yields. the 2.3-2.65% range looks pretty strong and dooms eur/usd to its current 1.04-1.09 range. that'll change if the ecb's view of the world changes after the french elections (which i suspect it will) and there's a greater tolerance of higher bund yields in particular. but for now, we're stuck."" back to equities, where we find asian shares turning mildly lower on thursday after touching near two-year highs.  msci's broadest index of asia-pacific shares outside japan was down 0.2 percent, stepping back from morning trade when it nudged close its loftiest levels since june 2015. australian shares firmed 0.4 percent, helped by an overnight gain in oil prices. china stocks were headed for a fourth day of losses amid worries over property market prospects, sharp declines in newly-listed stocks , and liquidity stress as the month-end approached. the csi300 index was down 1.0 percent, while the shanghai composite index lost 1 percent. the tightening trend in china continued, with the one-day loan rate on the shanghai stock exchange, which reflects demand from non-bank financial institutions, jumping before a long weekend (china markets closed monday and tuesday) and as the pboc holds off on using a liquidity tool for the fifth day in a row. the overnight repurchase rate traded on the shanghai exchange surges as much as 21.67% points to 32%, before closing at 14.96%; in hong kong’s offshore market, yuan tomorrow next forward points surge as much as 44 points, the most since jan. 25. the pboc again skipped reverse-repurchase operations for the fifth day in a row, taking net withdrawals during the period to 290 billion yuan due to maturities . on the first two days, the pboc cited “high liquidity,” then over the next two days it referred to “appropriate liquidity.” on thursday the monetary authority said that there was “high liquidity” in the banking system, and that fiscal spending toward the end of the month offsets reverse repo maturities. in europe, the stoxx europe 600 index rose 0.1% at 10:29 a.m. in london after closing wednesday at the highest since december 2015; the germany's dax continues to close in on record highs seen in 2015. the dollar index, which tracks the u.s. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was slightly up on the day at 100.030 . it was lifted to a one-week high overnight as the euro slipped on concerns about the impact of brexit as well as news that ecb policymakers are keen to reassure investors that their easy-money policy is far from ending.  sterling steadied at after skidding to a one-week low of $1.2377 previously. ""brexit, to some extent, has been covered in the market already. people went short, covered, and went short again,"" said kaneo ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm global-info co in tokyo. ""as for the dollar, demand is still steady from pure commercial orders, but the japanese fiscal year ends this week and tokyo investors don't want to take new positions,"" ogino said. despite the dollar's gains on the day, it was far lower than levels above 115 yen hit a few weeks ago, and japan's nikkei stock index shed 0.8 percent. ""investors have bought japanese stocks mainly because of the strong dollar-yen trend. trump's healthcare defeat threw a wet blanket on the japan market's rally since last november,"" said takuya takahashi, a strategist at daiwa securities. as we observed yesterday , comments from boston fed president eric rosengren and san francisco fed president john williams also backed multiple rate hikes, though those officials are non-fomc voters. ""there's a huge political fog around the world, in asia, in the u.s., but underneath it, there's actually quite a decent economic recovery. and that's what's driving markets more than the worries about politics,"" said sean taylor, asia pacific chief investment officer at deutsche asset management.  ""the u.s. is continuing to do well. europe isn’t doing as badly as it was and because of the commodity pickup last year, emerging markets are doing okay,"" he said. the commodity space saw some profit taking, with west texas intermediate dropping 0.3% to $49.38 a barrel, after surging 2.4% on wednesday after a bigger-than-forecast decline in u.s. gasoline stockpiles. gold slipped 0.2 percent to $1,250.48 an ounce. today, traders will look for the latest data on jobless claims and personal spending. * * * bulletin headline summary from ransquawk market snapshot top overnight news asian equities traded mostly in the red after the region shrugged off the mostly positive lead from wall street where the energy sector outperformed following a smaller than expected build in does. nikkei 225 (-0.8%) failed to benefit from a weaker jpy amid fiscal year-end rebalancing, while asx 200 (+0.4%) bucked the trend and was led by the strength in the commodities complex. hang seng (-0.3%) and shanghai comp. (-1.0%) were dampened despite a positive earnings report from big 4 bank china construction bank, as the pboc refrained again from conducting open market operations for the 5th consecutive day while there were also reports the trump administration are to make preparations to keep large tariffs on chinese goods. 10yr jgbs were lower despite the cautious risk tone with demand dampened after the latest weekly securities transactions data showed foreign investors increased their selling of japanese bonds by more than 3-fold, while today's 2 year auction also failed to provide any meaningful support with the b/c and lowest accepted price below prior. pboc refrained from open markets operations again, which resulted to a net daily drain of cny 40bin. top asian news in european markets, the notable highlight of the morning has come in the form of the regional cpis from germany, which have generally printed lower than previous, while also coming in under the expected figure for the national reading. the softer cpi numbers have seen upside in bunds. while periphery yields are lower in tandem this morning, with much of the attention here falling on the supply from italy, which was relatively well digested. away from the german data, european equities have had a slow start to the morning with little in terms of firm direction. on a sector specific basis, energy names are the significant outperformers, with this coming in tandem with wti futures briefly retaking usd 49.50/bbl to the upside. elsewhere h&m are firmly at the bottom of the stoxx 600 after a downbeat sales update. top european news in currencies, the euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.0736, after declining 0.9 percent over the previous two days. the british pound was little changed. the bloomberg dollar spot index rose 0.2 percent.  not too much to note in the fx markets other than some calm in gbp trade. some modest weakness seen early on, but this looks to have dissipated in the wake of the article 50 activation yesterday. all eyes on eur/gbp to see whether the usual month end flow will impact, but the pair looks well contained in the mid 0.8600's for now. from the eur perspective, regional german inflation has softened in march, while the eu wide sentiment indices for business and consumers have missed on expectations, softening a tad on the month also. eur/usd has drifted (very) steadily lower through the session, but we expect to find support around 1.0700 - if we get there - with close to 2 yards rolling off at the ny cut later today. usd/jpy has traded a very tight range around 111.00, with limited movement in ust yields to trade off. the key 10yr rate is hemmed inside 2.35-2.40%, with the recent fed speak doing little to spark fresh movement on the curve. more to come from mester, kaplan, williams and dudley, but we see little that can change sentiment other than from yellen herself. hard data now counts for more - as the fomc consistently communicate data dependency - with core pce prices due out alongside the final reading of q4 gdp today and the usual weekly claims data. in commodities, the broader recovery in the global risk mood looks to have aided the rise in base metals if nothing else, with little to differentiate in terms of the latest gains seen across the board. copper gains have pushed tentatively through usd2.65, and is struggling a little, with similar price action elsewhere. given the recent pull-back in the usd, some would have expected a little more upside, which has also helped oil prices to a modest degree, but the lower rise in inventory as reflected in both the doe and apis has largely been the driver here, further 'supported' by the disruptions in libya. wti still struggling ahead of usd50.00 however. gold still trading on a usd1250.00 handle, as silver is above usd18.00, with the tentative recovery in the greenback prompting cautious trade from here. on today's calendar, in the us this afternoon we’ll get the third and final revision to q4 gdp (expected to be nudged up to +2.0% qoq annualized) along with core pce. the latest weekly initial jobless claims print will also be released. it’s another busy day for fedspeak with mester, kaplan, williams and dudley all scheduled to speak. over at the ecb board members praet and nowotny are also due to speak this morning. also worth watching today is a meeting between president trump and head of the national economic council gary cohn where it is expected that the president will be briefed on outlines over options for tax reform. us event calendar central banks db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap so the grind higher in markets following the ahca vote debacle last week continues to trudge along in a fairly orderly fashion. with the s&p 500 nudging up another +0.11% yesterday the index is now up +1.68% from monday’s low point and has barely looked back. we’ve highlighted a few times this week that we think that trump trades had already been priced out to a large degree and so therefore the disappointment over last friday’s news may be limited with global growth being the most important factor for now. indeed it perhaps tells you something that yesterday was the third lowest volume day for the s&p 500 this year and the vix declined for the fourth session in a row and is not far off the lows of the recent year to date range again. while politics will continue to be an important theme – indeed there are reports this morning suggesting that republicans are considering a resurrection of the healthcare bill vote again next week - global data surprises are approaching six-year highs and for now it feels like this might be the more important near term driver. the more significant moves in markets yesterday however came in bonds where yields fell across the board seemingly sparked by a reuters story which suggested that ecb policymakers are becoming wary of making any new change to their policy message next month. this follows concerns at the ecb that the market over interpreted the message sent out at its march 9th meeting and were swift to start pricing in hikes. the article stated that the intention of the ecb was to communicate reduced tail risk but that instead the market took it as a step to the exit. the article also quoted its sources for the report saying that a previously mentioned deposit rate hike prior to the unwind of qe purchases “would be a communication nightmare” and that “if you raise rates, you can’t communicate that it’s a one-off” and that instead “the market would immediately price in a new rate path”. as is always the case with these stories there’s always a validity question with regards to the origin of the content and in this case the report quotes ‘six sources’ without any more specifics. that said there’s no smoke without fire and bond yields were quick to move lower in the wake of the story hitting the wires. by the end of play 10y bund yields had finished 4.5bps lower at 0.342% and are now at the lowest yield in 3 weeks. yields in spain, italy and portugal fell 4.6bps, 2.3bps and 6.0bps respectively also. market implied pricing for a 15bp hike in the deposit rate was also pushed back from april 2018  to august 2018 midway through the day. the story also appeared to be attributed to the decent bid for treasuries which saw the 10y yield tumble 4.1bps and hit the lowest closing yield, at 2.377%, since february 27th. that was despite a chorus of relatively hawkish fedspeak which we’ll touch on shortly. the euro (-0.45%) was also the second worst performing g10 currency yesterday while european banks fell nearly -1% intraday but pared losses to a more modest -0.21% decline. still, that was in the context of a +0.33% gain for the broader stoxx 600 after the energy complex rose on the back of a +2.36% rise for wti oil and the most in two weeks. away from that there was also a close eye kept on uk pm theresa may’s statement to the house of commons yesterday as well as the official withdrawal letter following the confirmation of article 50 being triggered. in a nutshell there wasn’t a huge amount new on the uk side of things compared to what was revealed in the government’s white paper last month. as our economists noted the uk continues to want to reach agreement on a comprehensive new deal with the eu27 in parallel with the terms of the divorce by march 2019, an unrealistic timetable and one the eu27 opposes. from the eu27 side, eu council president donald tusk responded with a statement of his own and the eu council released an official statement. the body language from tusk was negative. tusk mentioned damage limitation as the primary goal. combined with last week's comments from commission negotiator barnier on the priority of divorce negotiations and recent press reports, an early assessment of the eu's stance is that they plan to offer the uk a take-it-or-leave-it option (settlement of the divorce including the uk's budgetary commitments, then a limited transitional deal), but are preparing for a hard outcome. so with mutually contradictory goals and significant political obstacles for compromise it looks set to be a long drawn out negotiation process with the two year clock now quietly ticking away. it’s also worth highlighting that today the uk government will release a white paper concerning the repeal of the eu acquis, and its translation into domestic law. our economists highlight that this is important for negotiations as the eu27 argue the uk will have to remain under the authority of the ecj under a transitional deal. on april 27th a special eu council will be convened to discuss the broad framework for the negotiations. detailed negotiations are only likely to start in june. in the next few days, it will also be worth closely monitoring rhetoric from both the uk and eu27. so a few things to watch out for. to the latest in asia now where bourses have slowly drifted lower over the course of the session despite there being little in the way of newsflow. the nikkei (-0.25%), hang seng (-0.40%), shanghai comp (-0.86%) and kospi (-0.23%) are all in the red while the asx (+0.30%) is just about holding on to gains. it’s possible that the moves reflect some quarter end profit taking following a strong run for asia equities so far this year. futures in the us are little changed and in commodities oil is holding onto yesterday’s gains while gold is slightly lower. back to that fedspeak yesterday which as we briefly mentioned earlier was fairly hawkish despite limited market reaction. boston fed president rosengren said that “my own view is that an increase at every other fomc meeting over the course of this year could and should be the committee’s default”, in other words suggesting that he favours 4 hikes this year. this was a view somewhat echoed by the san francisco fed president williams who said that he “would not rule out more than three increases total for this year” and also that the fed could look to begin shrinking its balance sheet before knowing the size it ultimately should be. away from that the economic data was especially thin on the ground yesterday. in the us pending home sales rebounded +5.5% mom in february and more than expected. in the uk mortgage approvals nudged down to 68.3k while net consumer credit printed at £1.4bn in february which was a slowdown compared to the £1.6bn average over the prior six months. before we look at today’s calendar, it’s worth highlighting that yesterday our global economics perspectives team published a new report in which they provide ‘quick’ answers to a list of questions they have received from clients globally in recent days. the bulk of the questions this week have been on

4364,"Morgan Stanley Finds A ""Stunning Divergence"" In The Economic Data",2017-03-29 01:56:00+00:00,"since we first highlighted the data , there has been a great deal of attention paid to the post-election divergence between the so-called soft (sentiment) data in the us, and the hard (quantifiable) data. morgan stanley's chief equity and rates strategists note ""the divergence is stunning."" upside surprises appear to be completely driven by the soft data while hard data are simply coming in about as expected. this was underscored by the fact the fed made little revision to its economic forecasts at the march fomc meeting. essentially, the hard data are unfolding in line with the fed's 2017 outlook. there is a record gap between the strength of 'hard' and 'soft' us macro data simply put, the hard data on the economy is still looking far too soft. morgan stanley offers an additional compelling take on capturing this hard versus soft divergence. compare the new york federal reserve bank’s current 1q gdp tracking vs ours - frbny is currently tracking 1q gdp at 3.0% versus us around 1%. the difference is larger than usual and is being driven by the fact that the new york fed incorporates soft data into its tracking (attempting to tie it econometrically to gdp, a very hard thing to do especially in real-time). our method translates the incoming hard data into its gdp equivalent. note that the atlanta fed’s gdpnow tracking also focuses on hard data and is currently tracking 1% for 1q gdp (exhibit 2). will the hard and soft data reconcile, and in what direction? optically, a 2q gdp bounce back would perhaps be taken by markets as the hard data correcting to the soft data—in other words, risk appetite may find renewed inspiration as positive hard data unfolds. but from an economist’s point of view, smoothing through the volatility simply looks like the outlook for around 2% growth remains intact. moreover, we do expect that the breadth of the 2q rebound in hard data will be fairly limited, with a swing in consumption as the main driver of the expected 2q upside, followed by a slightly better net trade and inventory profile. as a consequence, we would not necessarily expect 'hard data' surprise indices to start racing higher if the factors behind the 2q growth rebound remain narrowly confined to a few sectors as we expect. additionally, as we noted previously, the problem - for the hope enthusiasts - is the last 5 times that the gap between perceived economic reality and actual economic reality was near this high, the s&p 500 had a troblesome few weeks/months after: still, this time will probably be different. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Morgan Stanley March FOMC New York Fed Federal Reserve Volatility Reality Federal Reserve Bank,1
4417,"""They 'Buy The Dip' Yet Again"": Global Stocks, US Futures Rebound; Dollar Rises Off 4 Month Lows",2017-03-28 11:31:00+00:00,"european, asian stocks have rebounded as investor anxiety over trump economic policy and us tax reform eased following yesterday's remarkable comeback in the us market. s&p futures point to a slightly higher open, with oil higher and the dollar rebounding off fout month lows. it is a relatively quiet day in the us with the economic calendar focusing on wholesale inventories, consumer confidence and the case-shiller index. european and asian equities rose and s&p 500 futures edged higher as investor bullishness returned after the failure of u.s. president donald trump’s health-care bill.  hopes that the trump administration will now prioritize tax reforms coupled with still-robust economic data and corporate earnings forecasts spurred some investors to look past creeping doubts about trump’s ability to deliver on campaign promises. according to bloomberg , the resumption of demand for risk assets signals investors are still pinning hopes on trump’s ability to push through tax cuts and regulatory changes, pledges that helped trigger a reflationary upswing in global markets after his election. "" bond and fx market participants’ reaction to the failure of the health-care bill has been to re-price treasuries and the dollar under the assumption that president trump has lost a little of his shine,"" kit juckes, a london-based global strategist at societe generale sa, wrote in a note. “ equity market participants have taken a look at the lower yields and weaker dollar and decided that since absurdly low rates are the elixir that the equity bull market lives on , they might as ‘buy the dip’ yet again .” europe's stoxx 600 rose 0.4% helped by financials and pharmaceutical stocks. futures on the s&p 500 rose 0.1 percent. the underlying gauge dropped 0.1 percent monday, paring a loss of as much as 0.9 percent. in fx, the dollar index against a basket of major currencies edged up 0.1 percent to 99.252, after plumbing a trough of 98.858 overnight, its lowest level since nov. 11. ""risky asset markets have rebounded from yesterday’s opening low, supporting our view of the current market setback as a risk pause and not a turning point towards generally lower risk valuations ,"" analysts at morgan stanley said in a note to clients. morgan stanley said that given some of the savings that were to come from replacing obamacare would be lost, the upcoming tax reform may turn out to be a smaller package or result in a higher fiscal deficit. the dollar steadied after its worst week since trump’s election after talk of more rises in federal reserve interest rates this year. ""clearly we shouldn't forget we are going to see at least two more hikes by the fed this year and that there is still the potential for the next one to be pulled forward to june,"" said cibc strategist jeremy stretch. sterling edged up a notch, trading within a narrow range as britain prepared to start formal divorce proceedings with the european union on wednesday. recent weakness in the dollar underpinned crude oil prices though persistent worries about oversupply kept gains in check. prices for front-month brent crude futures were up 0.6 percent. in the united states, wti crude futures rose 0.7% . yields on 10-year tsys were unchanged at 2.38% after falling three basis points on monday. european bonds mostly rose, with 10-year german yields falling one basis point to 0.39 percent. on today's calenar, fed chair yellen will make a speech on workforce development in low-income communities. although it does not seem like she will address monetary policy, we will watch her speech for any clues about the fed's thinking. otherwise, tuesday looks set to be a very quiet day. in the us, the conference board consumer confidence index for march will probably rise further. bulletin headline summary from ransquawk us markets top overnight news asian market sentiment improved as the region's major indices shrugged-off the subdued wall street lead and traded mostly positive. asx 200 (+1.1%) outperformed with the index led by financial and energy sectors, while nikkei 225 (+1.1%) was underpinned as exporters found early respite from the recent jpy advances and with participants noted be on the bid ahead of ex-dividend dates. china traded mixed as the hang seng (+0.5%) conformed to the upbeat tone seen in its major regional counterparts, while shanghai comp. (-0.4%) lagged after the pboc refrained from open market operations for the 3rd consecutive session, which resulted in a daily net liquidity drain of cny 70bin. 10yr jgbs traded slightly lower with demand dampened amid an improvement in risk sentiment and also following the enhanced liquidity jgb auction which saw weaker demand than the prior. pboc refrained from open markets operations for a 3rd consecutive session, for a daily net drain of cny 70bin. top asian news europe likewise has seen a brighter spark for equities with much of the upside attributed to an unwind of yesterday's flight to quality price action. the reprieve in commodity prices has seen energy and material names among the best performers. however, market moves have been somewhat contained ahead of the invoking of a.50 tomorrow. of note, members of the scottish parliament are to vote on giving first minister sturgeon authority to call a second independent referendum. in credit markets, french opinion polls keep oats afloat with polls showing macron would ease to victory ahead of le pen. in turn, this has alleviated concerns of the french political risk, subsequently narrowing the ge-fr spread (currently 57.5bps).this has also accounted for 2yr german schatz yields rising, although the upside will likely be capped given the ongoing collateral squeeze as we approach month-end and financial year-end, the schatz also saw a particularly soft auction today, which was technically uncovered (1.1) and saw a retention of 27.75%. top european news in currencies, the rand slid 1.9 percent to 12.98 against the dollar at 10:38 a.m. in london following monday’s 2.5 percent decline. prior to this drop, the currency had gained 9.5 percent year-to-date, making it a top emerging-market performer. the british pound climbed 0.2 percent to 1.2581. the bloomberg dollar spot index rose 0.1 percent after dropping 0.4 percent monday. the usd recovery has been a modest one this morning, with limited upside traction seen in usd/jpy. gains have extended to a little over 110.80, but with the market waiting for the next move from the trump administration, treasuries find some near term support. the key 10yr rate is holding off 2.40%, and is only 3-4 bps higher from eur/usd has pulled back off the 1.0900 level, and the market may sense the response to the policy shift at the ecb is now adjusted for. this is not to preclude a move on 1.0950 or 1.1000, but with french election fever hotting up from next week, gains may prove tough. similar price action seen in gbp today as we saw monday, though cable gains towards 1.2600 are struggling amid modest usd buying. eur/gbp continues to press for 0.8600-10 on the downside, the support here is likely to be aided by the familiar month end flow from europe. article 50 set to be triggered tomorrow, and even though this looks priced in, we cannot account for the subsequent rhetoric from europe which may or may note add some colour to the negotiations which lie ahead. in commodities, gold fell 0.1 percent at $1,253.50 an ounce after rising 0.9 percent monday. west texas intermediate crude rose 0.8 percent at $48.11 per barrel following a 0.5 percent drop the previous day. as the usd recovers on the modest drop off in treasuries, precious metals have come back off better levels, but not to any notable degree. the tenuous recovery in risk assets is largely behind this, as the market awaits the next move from the trump administration — on tax reform. gold still above usd1250.00, silver usd18.00. in contrast, base metals have recovered, though perhaps unconvincingly as yet — for the same reasons as above. iron ore prices have come under pressure from chinese stockpiles also, and this naturally impacts across the board. copper is tentatively back above usd2.60. oil prices also stabilise, with further comments — from iran — that an extension to the production cuts agreed to late last year is on the table. inventory levels and prospective shale production continues to counterbalance any relief rally. iranian oil minister says that extending the opec and non-opec deal is likely but time is required in order to evaluate the decision. looking at the day ahead, the early data is the advance goods trade balance reading for february and the preliminary wholesale inventories data for february. following that we’ll get the s&p/case- shiller house price index print in january before we then get the march consumer confidence print (expected to nudge down to 114.0 from 114.8) and richmond fed manufacturing survey. away from the data it is a busy day for  fedspeak. the fed’s george speaks this afternoon at 12.45pm before fed chair yellen speaks shortly after at 12.50pm. the chair is however scheduled to speak on workforce development challenges so there is little suggestion that she will touch on monetary policy. also due up today is kaplan at 1pm and powell at 4.30pm. the other potentially interesting event today is the  scottish parliament debate on a independence referendum. us event calendar central banks * * * db's jim reid concludes the overnight wrap after a bad start to the us session it felt like the market had its own sugar hit as the day wore on yesterday. indeed whether you're shocked at the fact that the s&p 500 only fell -0.10% yesterday (after being as low as -0.94% intra-day) perhaps depends on how much you think trump's most radical policies were priced into markets. there is an argument for saying that such trades weren't actually priced in much anyway. the examples discussed yesterday within db were that the 1) fed funds market pricing are well below the fomc dots; 2) the dollar index is now back to where it was at the end of october; 3) the s&p 500 has been performing similarly to how it normally does after a close election even if there was a small pop up in february; and 4) that global pmis are all consistent with where equities should be given the recent strength - a point we've made in previous emrs. what we don't know though is if some of the strong survey data contains some element of animal spirits only there because of trump optimism. the fact that global numbers have been strong perhaps indicates that a lot of the optimism is in fact a global story and not a trump one. so unless the global story turns then the healthcare debacle shouldn't be too big a hit. having said that, failure in the tax reform agenda will surely have more impact on animal spirits given its economic importance . so all to play for even if on some measures little obvious indication of success is priced in. in markets the leader of the big selloff at the us open yesterday were banks which tumbled over -2.50% within the first 10 minutes or so of trading. in doing so that meant us banks briefly entered correction territory after plummeting -10.70% from the early month highs. after that, like the broader index, the sector bounced back impressively into the close and although finished a shade in the red by the end of play at -0.37% still recouped over 2% of the early losses. that move also came in the face of another day of tumbling treasury yields with the 10y finishing the day 3.4bps lower at 2.379%. that is the lowest closing yield now since february 27th although yields did briefly dip below 2.350% at one stage yesterday. it’s worth noting that chicago fed president charles evans said yesterday that he sees the possibility of the fed only hiking one more time this year should uncertainty continue to linger around the outlook for inflation and government spending. the excitement for volatility also peaked fairly early in the day yesterday after the vix touched an intraday high of 15.11 and the highest since november, before then settling back to finish at 12.50 and down over 3% on the day. meanwhile gold (+0.91%) found a bid amongst the risk-off moves and in doing so has now rebounded nearly 5% from the early month lows. elsewhere metals had a day to forget with copper (-0.76%), aluminium (-0.46%) and iron ore (-4.10%) all down, while in fx the greenback retreated -0.46% although as we noted above is back to pretty much where it was in october last year. it’s worth noting that the biggest mover in currencies yesterday was the south african rand which tumbled -2.57% following the news that president zuma ordered finance minister gordhan to return home early from investor meetings in the uk and us. while there was no reason provided much of the chatter was that zuma is preparing for an imminent cabinet reshuffle, raising uncertainty further around what is already a fragile situation. as we refresh our screens this morning it appears that the positive momentum which saw wall street pare early losses has continued into asia. the nikkei (+1.07%), hang seng (+0.52%), kospi (+0.28%) and asx (+1.12%) are amongst the bourses higher while markets in china are largely flat. us equity index futures are also up about +0.20% while gold has eased back a touch and rates markets are generally holding in around yesterday’s levels. moving on. yesterday we saw the latest ecb cspp numbers where the average daily rate of purchases of €308mn last week was the lowest outside of the summer and xmas lull (average since start of €365mn). one week's numbers do not make a trend but with the ecb tapering as of next week there will be some speculation that they are preparing to lower purchases. we'll know in two weeks when the first week of april numbers are in. these will be important in working out the direction of spreads as this will give us an idea of whether they are planning tapering credit purchases as well as governments. at the moment i would say the consensus is that they taper credit less. the rest of the data yesterday was a little less exciting. in germany the ifo survey surprised to the upside after the headline business climate reading rose 1.2pts in march to 112.3. expectations had been for no change. the details also revealed a relatively equal contribution from both the expectations (+1.5pts to 105.7) and current assessment (+0.9pts to 119.3) components. our economists in germany made the point that the survey corroborates the strength of the pmi’s heading into q2 and that both indices point to about 0.7% qoq gdp growth in q1. the hard data continues to tell a different story though and the february hard data points will be important to gauge when and how this divergence will be resolved. meanwhile the other data out in europe yesterday was the ecb’s money and credit aggregates for february. m3 money supply growth was reported as slowing slightly to +4.7% yoy from +4.8% and as a result roughly staying in the range of the last couple of years. the credit side of the numbers also saw some retreat following strong january data. banks lending to households slowed while lending to corporates saw its slowest pace in 5 months with the annual growth of corporate lending retreating to +2.0% yoy from +2.3%. markets in europe largely ignored the data yesterday and instead followed much of the lead from across the pond with the stoxx 600 closing -0.40% but paring early heavier losses. in the us yesterday the sole release was the dallas fed’s manufacturing survey which was reported as falling 7.6pts in march to 16.9 (vs. 22.0 expected). looking at the day ahead, this morning in europe it’s a particularly quiet start with no notable data due out, although we will hear from a couple of ecb speakers in coeure and makuch. over in the us this afternoon the early data is the advance goods trade balance reading for february and the preliminary wholesale inventories data for february. following that we’ll get the s&p/case- shiller house price index print in january before we then get the march consumer confidence print (expected to nudge down to 114.0 from 114.8) and richmond fed manufacturing survey. away from the data it is a busy day for  fedspeak. the fed’s george speaks this afternoon at 4.45pm gmt before fed chair yellen speaks shortly after at 4.50pm gmt. the chair is however scheduled to speak on workforce development challenges so there is little suggestion that she will touch on monetary policy. also due up today is kaplan at 5pm gmt and powell at 8.30pm gmt. the other potentially interesting event today is the

4451,How To Beat Warren Buffett Working Just 40 Days A Year,2017-03-27 20:11:00+00:00,"want to beat warren buffett’s investment returns? don’t want to spend a lot of time working at it? bloomberg's macro strategist cameron crise has just the investment process for you... last week i wrote about a simple model that is surprisingly effective at profiting from the rebalancing tendencies of passive investors. this in turn brought to mind another well-known instance of behavioral herding that has led to consistent profits -- the so-called “pre-fomc drift,” wherein u.s. equities tend to rally just before and just after fomc meetings. what would happen if we combined the rebalancing model with a strategy designed to profit from the pre-fomc drift?  i assessed the performance of going long the s&p 500 on the close two days before each fomc meeting and exiting the trade on the close of each fomc day. in measuring the historical performance of such a model, it’s important that we don’t include any forward-looking information. some of the best daily s&p 500 returns have come on days featuring intra-meeting easings. alas, we have to exclude them from our study given our inability to pre-position for them. regardless, the performance of the combined model is still pretty fantastic. since 1994, it has generated an annual return of 8.6% with a volatility of 9.3%. that ratio (0.92) trounces the equivalent for a passive investment in the s&p 500, including dividends (0.69). not too shabby for 40 days of work per year (two days a month for the rebalancing model plus 2 days for each of the eight annual fed meetings)! given that the rebalancing model in particular is a mean-reversion strategy, it stands to reason that it should be a diversifier against a standard passive portfolio. what happens if we combine a passive allocation in the s&p with an overlay of the rebalancing and fed strategies? it turns out that the answer is “lots of good things.” combining the behavioral overlay with a passive investment boosts the average annual return of an spx long from 10.1% to 18.9% over the last 23 years. the realized vol of this strategy is higher, but only modestly so; the annualized volatility of the portfolio goes from 14.7% to 16.9%. notching an extra 8.8% return for an increased vol of just 2.2% is a pretty effective use of a risk budget! the chart shown above plots the cumulative returns of a passive investment in the s&p 500, a passive investment overlaid with the monthly rebalancing model, and a passive investment overlaid with both the rebalance and fed models. it also shows the cumulative returns of warren buffett’s berkshire hathaway over the same time frame. not only does the passive strategy with behavioral overlay trounce the passive strategy by itself (outperforming in 19 of the 23 years modeled), it also beats berkshire (while generating substantially less volatility). while the combined model only beats buffett about half of the time, the most notable successes have come in the last 10-15 years . obviously there is no guarantee that these behavioral overlays can deliver the same sort of outperformance in the future as they have in recent years. there is often a sort of “heisenberg principle” at work, wherein we alter the performance of a market phenomenon merely by observing it. moreover, the results above do not account for real-world considerations such as transaction costs, etc. (though those should be modest if futures are employed to implement the behavioral strategy.) nevertheless, the results portrayed above do suggest that there remains significant alpha to be had from mining the behavioral tendencies of market participants. warren buffett likes to sing the praises of graham and dodd, but they never won the nobel prize for economics; kahneman and tversky did. and if you can trounce both passive investors and warren buffett by trading just 40 days a year, that offers plenty of time to research the next market-beating anomaly before the street catches up. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett Volatility ETC,1
4484,"FX Week Ahead: Highlights Include Article 50 And Sterling, Q4 GDP And The USD",2017-03-27 11:42:00+00:00,"by shant movsesian (ransquawk) and rajan dhall msta (ransquawk/tradingview) uk in the spotlight this week as article 50 set to be triggered. is this priced in to gbp? we’ll find out. the usd may start to find some support as key levels (against its major counterparts) near. japanese year end on the friday. looking to next week, few can look past the impending triggering of article 50 – on wednesday – which is widely expected to produce a knee jerk hit on the pound. given the slow grind higher through the week, some would assume that much of this is priced in, with gbp arguably at (near term) fair value levels. the healthier mood in the pound has been partially ‘aided’ by the boe tone, where the majority of the mpc are warming to a rate hike closer in on the horizon. higher than expected inflation reported this week was followed up by stronger retail sales, which went against the anecdotal evidence suggesting pressures on household income, but this will likely pass through further down the line. cable remains inside 1.2000-1.2800 for now, so the focus could switch to eur/gbp again. the cross rate has been bolstered by the backdrop of improving data out of the eu as a whole, and this was underpinned by the pmi’s in germany and france on friday morning, leading to the composite index for both manufacturing and services beating expectations. the shift in ecb policy to a more neutral stance has also given the single currency a boost with some members advocating a rate move ahead of tapering. eur/usd is now challenging the sell zone through 1.0800, but this will prove tough going ahead of the french elections, along with the clear rate differentials, which cannot be ignored as the market looks to ‘price in’ what is effectively ‘normalisation’ much further ahead. we look for 1.0900-1.0950 as the next major area of resistance in eur/usd, and this will in part be down to what many see as an overreaction to the fomc’s ‘dovish hike’. there was a clear case to suggest that usd gains had been overrun in response to the dot plot almost 3 months ago, but the retracement may be close to running its course, with usd/jpy value buyers likely to step in from circa 110.00 levels. given next friday is japanese year end, we have to factor in some overshoot, but through this level, we can only see a major turnaround in global stocks taking us back to levels south of 107.00-108.00. equities have stabilised (somewhat predictably) in recent sessions, but we may get some pre weekend volatility after the healthcare vote late friday. focusing on us economic performance, thursday’s q4 gdp is the final reading, so core pce could be of greater influence on us treasury yields. little else of note apart from a range of fed speakers through the week. plenty more in japan to contend with, alongside repatriation flow, looking to the latest cpi data, industrial production and unemployment. in europe, we have a number of sentiment indices, headlined by germany’s ifo survey on monday, with the preliminary eu wide inflation releases towards the end of the week. the commodity currencies will be trading largely on the back of the usd as well as oil and base metals, though friday sees the jan gdp release for canada. friday’s cpi release was largely in line with expectations, giving credence to the cautious tone from the boc. it is worth noting that gov poloz is due to speak next week, but we are also watching the price action in oil prices, where wti is struggling to reclaim usd50.00. very little on the data schedule for either australia or nz, but we have domestic credit data in the former, which will shed some fresh light on worrisome residential leverage. anz business confidence also due. moody’s cited economic resilience in nz, and with the rbnz sounding a less urgent tone on exchange rates, we expect nzd to find a modicum of support near term. any opinions, chats, messages, news, research, analyses, prices, or other information contained on this website are provided as general market information for educational and entertainment purposes only, and do not constitute investment advice. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ] zerohedge.com advertise with us make sure to read our "" how to [read/tip off] zero hedge without attracting the interest of [human resources/the treasury/black helicopters] "" guide it would be very wise of you to study our disclaimer , our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure . here's our cookie policy . how to report offensive comments notice on racial discrimination .",Germany Japan Volatility Australia CPI Unemployment Price Action BOE RANSquawk France,1
4532,"""If All Goes According To Plan"": What Global Central Bank Normalization Would Look Like, In One Chart",2017-03-25 22:03:00+00:00,"as a result of countless failures by central banks to normalize monetary policy over the past 7 years, the market - especially bonds and rates - has become openly cynical and outright skeptical regarding the possibility of a successful renormalization of policy by global central banks. after all, japan has been trying to do that for over 30 years and has yet to succeed; the ecb hiked in 2011 resulting in near collapse of the eurozone. ironically, the recent trumpflation trade - which few expected as a result of the ""shocking"" trump election victory - has emerged as the most credible catalyst to prompt inflation not only in the us but around the globe, resulting in two fed rate hikes in rapid succession. still, now that obamacare repeal has failed, and questions are rising whether trump will be able to implement his proposed tax reform, the market has aggressively faded not only the broader trumpflation trade, but also all of the recent dollar strength since the us election: in short, bets on a ""bening"" global reflation are rapidly fading, suggesting that the latest push to normalize monetary policy will once again result in failure. and yet, ""what if it goes according to plan"" this time? that's the question posed by barclays' christian keller who notes that, at least for the time being, ""the synchronized upswing in the global economy continues, supporting sentiment, which thus far has ignored elevated policy uncertainties. headline inflation is increasing due to stable oil prices, while core inflation rates are mixed."" and, assuming nothing ahcnes, this sets the backdrop for monetary policy normalization, albeit at different speeds and modes. taking this thought experiment one step further, what would happen if indeed this time central banks are successful to renormalize monetary policy without leading to a market crash. in that case, barclays expects three fed hikes in 2017 and 2018, respectively. the ecb is likely to taper further in 2018 and to start increasing depo rates in parallel (in 2018). conveniently, barclays has created the following chart which lays out what ""coordinated global renormalization"" would look like. it can serve as a benchmark to those keeping tabs on where various central banks are in the current attempt to restore monetary normalcy. for those curious, here are some further thoughts from barclays: policy normallization at different speeds with growth improving across regions and deflationary threats fading, the monetary policy cycle has started to turn. market interest rates have been suggesting this for several months. recently, central bank communication has also become decidedly more confident about the outlook. while the activity upswing is synchronized, the pace of expansion remains diverse and economies are at very different positions in the cycle. thus, despite the signals are clearly for policy normalisation, we think such changes are likely to occur at quite different speeds. fed: a more confident fomc leads the way in contrast to 2015 and 2016, when economic developments at home and abroad thwarted the fed’s plans for a four-hike pace in the coming year, 2017 has started out differently: the fed now faces decent us growth, supported by buoyant sentiment, easier financial market conditions and no complications from ‘international developments’. this has given the fomc more confidence to finally implement its game plan of a gradual hiking cycle; we now expect it to hike two more times in 2017 (sep and dec) and three times in 2018 at a pace of 25bp each time. a hike this june – not our baseline – would suggest a faster pace of four hikes per year, in our view. along with this firmer tightening cycle, we also expect the fed to begin earnest discussions over when and in what manner to reduce the size of its balance sheet. even so, we continue to believe that the fed is far from taking any concrete action and we expect its balance sheet to remain substantively unchanged through at least the end of 2018. ecb: complicated normalization ahead better growth and the rebound in inflation has significantly improved the balance of risks for the ecb by reducing the threat of a deflationary ‘japan’ scenario for the euro area. however, the euro area is still far away from comfortable self-sustaining inflationary dynamics, and it still faces the looming risks associated with fragile public debt dynamics. the latter is particularly sensitive with regard to the euro area’s third largest economy and world’s third largest debt market, italy, where there still appears a lack of political resolve for reform and uncertainty about the political outlook remains high. while this calls for caution, abovetarget headline inflation in germany and the adverse effects of negative deposit rates on financial institutions are creating pressure on the ecb to start normalizing monetary policy. in an attempt to balance these factors, we expect the ecb to implement a mixed strategy: this would clearly be a significant shift from earlier communication that suggested rate hikes would only follow once the asset purchase program had been terminated – which was the sequence the fed and boe used. of course, neither the fed nor boe ventured into negative policy rates or had to implement qe across a diverse sovereign debt market. such a multipronged exit strategy by the ecb would present a delicate communications act, as markets would have to decipher the net effects of a simultaneous tightening via deposit rate hikes and continuing expansion via asset purchases, even if at a reduced pace. given the risk of adverse shocks (on inflation or debt dynamics) and memories of past episodes of premature tightening, we expect the ecb to move cautiously. boj: ready to follow the boj stood pat in march, as widely expected, and did not provide any hints of a future move or change in related communications. however, as the global environment remains supportive, we expect the boj to: this will leave the boj in a reactive position as its yield-targeting policy since september has allowed it to ‘import’ passively the tightening in the us and other core markets. overall, our inflation forecasts suggest that while the boj may have overcome deflation, the 2% target – which it promises to overshoot – is still not on the horizon. boe: still sitting on the fence surprisingly resilient data have made the boe more confident about the economic outlook. march meeting minutes reported some members moving closer to supporting a hike, with mpc forbes (outgoing in june) even voting for an immediate hike. however, we expect the rest of the mpc, in particular governor carney, to move more cautiously, waiting for data to crystallize before considering adjusting its  monetary policy stance. given our expectation for a slowing economy and only a temporary fx-driven boost in inflation, the mpc will most likely remain on hold over the forecast horizon, while markets have started to price some probability of a hike in 2018. pboc: focused on stability the pboc continues to balance multiple objectives: supporting the growth target, while containing the build-up of financial vulnerabilities and the outflow of capital. its recent increases of short- (omos) and medium-term (mlf) policy rates seem targeted to the latter goals and we expect the pboc to follow up with more 10bp hikes in omo and mlf rates in the coming months, especially if the domestic housing market continues to perform strongly and the fed hikes rates further. at the same time, we expect it to leave the benchmark interest rates unchanged through 2017, to support growth, given that the bulk of china’s total financing is still dominated by bank lending (guided by the 1y benchmark lending rate). however, if cpi inflation developments look to exceed the 3% target and/or growth stayed above 6.5% q/q saar, the pboc could consider benchmark rate hikes as well. by using the shorter-term policy rates (10bp each time), rather than the traditional  benchmark deposit and lending rates (usually 25bp each), the pboc’s is attempting to achieve multiple objectives at the same time: guiding banks’ borrowing costs higher to promote financial deleveraging, while keeping benchmark rates unchanged to support growth: the bulk of china’s total financing is still dominated by bank lending (guided by the 1y benchmark lending rate at 4.35%), and the transmission from changes in the costs of the central banks’ liquidity instruments to banks’ lending rates will only be gradual. this strategy likely also serves the pboc as an experiment, as it explores the transmission process of its various monetary tools with the objective to move its policy framework away from direct quantity-based measures to indirect price-based measures. tips: tips [ at ] zerohedge.com general: info [ at ] zerohedge.com legal: legal [ at ] zerohedge.com advertising: ads [ at ] zerohedge.com abuse/complaints: abuse [ at ]
