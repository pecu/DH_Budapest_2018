Moody’s headline’s seem to be giving a bid tone to CNY and CNH as soon as they hit the newswires but CNH is moving a bit randomly now, gaining on the headlines and the losing some of these gains again soon. The headlines, courtesy Reuters:
·       Moody’s official: Never thought China’s economy will have hard landing

·       Moody’s official says China economic growth will slow

However, as a warning shot Moody's also says that China may no longer get A1 rating if there are signs that debt keeps rising and that debt exceeds expectations. 

Remember, Moody’s had downgraded China two days back leading to a modest CNY selloff but the currency has been bid since then.The USDCY  fix today was also lower than expected at 6.8698 versus expected at ~ 6.8770
