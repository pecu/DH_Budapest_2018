ECB's Coeure speaking to Reuters 18 May

ECB cash facility working well, has flexibility
elections should not weigh much in decisions
inflation rise not yet durable, self-sustaining
no shortage of German bonds
rate hike possible, in abstract ( theory), if neg depo rate hurts lending
ECB shouldn't wait too long before taking away support
sequence of future policy steps in guidance "not set in stone"
credibility of fwd guidance depends on its adjustment to facts
Rate hike talk theoretical again.
No great shocks in any of the above.
He adds:

ECB to discuss including Greece in QE only after Eurogroup debt measures, IMF board meeting, closure of review
IMF presence in Greek programme not a necessity for ECB but would provide comfort
Meanwhile EURUSD still slipping at 1.1125 amid general USD demand

sentence: has flexibility
elections should not weigh much in decisions
inflation rise not yet durable
