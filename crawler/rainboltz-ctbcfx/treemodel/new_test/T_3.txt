Initially it seemed the rates market would trade sideways or even marginally higher in ED futures, but after 12pm the market decided to sell off.
The cause of the back-up is a bit unclear.
However, there was certainly some front-end selling in EDM7 and front-end Fed fund futures, such as FFN7.
This pushed the June FOMC back up to nearly 80% probability despite rather dovish comments from Kashkari.
There also seemed to be some paying in the Dec FOMC, which added another 3bp of hikes for 2017 bringing Fed pricing to 36bp for the full year.
2018 seems to be a little bit underpriced with only around 27 bp of hikes ¡V or in other words, just one hike.
At the March FOMC meeting, the FED members projected three hikes for 2017 and three hikes for 2018.
While historically they have been over-optimistic with their hike projections (just one realized hike per year in 2015 and 2016), it seems that for the first time in a while they might reach their forecast goal for 2017.
That being said, the dislocation in 2018 is quite large with the market pricing of only 25bp of hikes versus the Fed¡¦s 75bp projection.
The basis market continued the tightening trend in FRA vs OIS, 3s1s and 6s3s.
The last couple of days it finally seemed to also drag down the 6s3s basis, which for a long time could withstand the aggressive tightening of the other basis¡¦.
The buying from the APAC region has recently faded, so there seems to be less support in the rather elevated belly (3y to 5y part) of the curve.
In combination with the tighter spot roll, which grinds towards 15bp, the 6s3s basis was offered across the curve.
Meanwhile, 3s1s is reaching impressive low levels with M7 roll trading as low as 6.25bp.
Should 1m Libor fixings accelerate even further into the FOMC meeting, the basis could trade as low as 4bp.
Today¡¦s fix was a bit surprising with lower 1m, 3m and 6m LIBOR.
While it seems that there is little demand for 3m and 6m Libor over the last few weeks, I was surprised to see 1m fixing lower only one day after it jumped by 1.2bp.
That being said, I think there is the chance to see a reversal of this move which, could lead to further 3s1s basis contraction.
