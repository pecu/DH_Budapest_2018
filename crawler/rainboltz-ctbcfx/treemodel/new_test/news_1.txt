BOE holds policy but may tighten sooner than forecast
    The Bank of England (BOE) kept its key Bank Rate and stimulus measures unchanged but said monetary policy "could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than the very gently rising path implied by the market yield curve underlying the May projections."
Today's guidance is slightly more hawkish than in March when the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said "some modest withdrawal of monetary stimulus" may be appropriate.
Kristin Forbes was once again the lone dissenting member of the MPC, voting to immediately raise the Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 0.25 percent, saying "inflation was already above the target, and pipeline pressures suggested it would continue to increase to uncomfortable levels and remain above the target for over three years," according to minutes from the meeting.
In March Forbes, who is due to leave the MPC at the end of June, became the first member to vote for an increase since July 2016.
But as in March, other members of the MPC are also leaning toward tighter policy, with the minutes saying it "would take relatively little further upside news on the prospects for activity or inflation for them to consider that a more immediate reduction in policy support might be warranted."
At this month's meeting, there were only eight members of the MPC and not the usual nine as Deputy Governor Charlotte Hogg, who has resigned, has yet to be replaced.
In addition to keeping the bank rate on hold, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain its stock of government bonds purchased at 435 billion pounds - known as quantitative easing - along with the 10 billion pound stock of corporate bonds that were purchased as part of a broad package of stimulus measures agreed in August last year as the BOE sought to shore up the economy after the Brexit vote.
But growth in the UK has been stronger than the BOE feared last year, mainly due to higher-than-expected consumption as consumer drew down savings.
But investment by businesses and in housing has also held up, the BOE said in its May inflation report.
Compared with the August 2016 forecast, annual growth in the first quarter of this year is seen at 2.2 percent, 1.2 percentage points above it had expected.
For the full year, UK Gross Domestic Product is now seen rising by 1.9 percent, down from the February forecast of 2.0 percent, then by 1.7 percent in 2018 and 1.8 percent in 2019.
"In the MPC's central forecast, weaker consumption this year is largely balanced by rising net trade and investment," the BOE said.
Employment is seen to be better than expected, with the unemployment rate now forecast at 4.7 percent in the second quarter of this year, down from February's forecast of 4.9 percent, then 4.7 percent in Q2 2018 compared with 5.0 percent, 4.6 percent in Q2 2019 and 4.5 percent in Q2 2020.
The BOE projects the Bank Rate, based on market rates, will be raised to 0.3 percent by the second quarter of next year, a slight reduction from 0.4 percent projected in February, and then 0.4 percent in Q2 2019, down from 0.5 percent, and then 0.5 percent by Q2 2020.
Due to the fall in the exchange rate of sterling in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union  (EU), known as Brexit, import prices have risen and thus pushed up overall inflation to above the BOE's 2.0 percent target.
Inflation in the UK was steady at 2.3 percent in March and February but the BOE expects it to rise further in coming months to 2.7 percent in the second quarter, up from its previous forecast of 2.4 percent.
In Q2 2018 inflation is seen at 2.6 percent, then 2.2 percent in Q2 2019 and 2.3 percent in the second quarter of 2020.
